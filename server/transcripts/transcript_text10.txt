0.12 --> 5.44  vidit Gujarati makes his way to the
2.44 --> 8.0  board he arrives first to this game in
5.44 --> 10.32  the all important Indian clash in the
8.0 --> 12.519  third round of the FED candidates it's
10.32 --> 15.599  vidit versus
12.519 --> 18.0  prananda vidit is in great form he beat
15.599 --> 20.72  Hikaru Nakamura in the second round
18.0 --> 24.039  while prananda suffered a defeat at the
20.72 --> 27.08  hands of gkes so it's clear that here
24.039 --> 28.880000000000003  withit will try to push in this game
27.08 --> 32.079  he's on one and half out of two we are
28.88 --> 34.8  in round three prag is on half point out
32.079 --> 37.52  of two there he arrives and as always
34.8 --> 39.919999999999995  prag brings with him a banana and a
37.52 --> 42.96  chocolate uh Shake of
39.92 --> 46.160000000000004  hands the general score between vidit
42.96 --> 49.039  and prag has been in favor of prananda
46.16 --> 51.959999999999994  at the Prague Masters if you remember it
49.039 --> 55.120000000000005  was a very intense encounter where prag
51.96 --> 56.480000000000004  managed to outwit with it on the after
55.12 --> 61.48  the 40th
56.48 --> 64.36  move let's see how things work out here
61.48 --> 68.67999999999999  and it is going to be very very
64.36 --> 71.2  important viit looks like in great form
68.68 --> 76.72  here the way in which he dismantled
71.2 --> 79.84  Nakamura in just 29 moves was just
76.72 --> 82.15899999999999  amazing and we are about to get to the
79.84 --> 85.72  start of the game The Players shake
82.159 --> 89.2  their hands and now vidit gets into his
85.72 --> 92.92  meditative pose he generally takes
89.2 --> 97.0  around 40 seconds 40 to 5050 seconds
92.92 --> 99.759  before he makes his move um the jury is
97.0 --> 103.399  still out there to decide what is he
99.759 --> 106.56  doing here is he meditating is he you
103.399 --> 110.0  know doing a prayer prag meanwhile I
106.56 --> 113.799  think looking at the game maybe of Wali
110.0 --> 116.399  there E4 by vidit he's opened his game
113.799 --> 118.84  with Pawn to E4 and prug instantly
116.399 --> 121.119  responds with Pawn to
118.84 --> 123.119  E5
121.119 --> 125.24  what are we going to witness today is it
123.119 --> 127.08  going to be the Italian or is it going
125.24 --> 131.84  to be the
127.08 --> 131.84  Spanish vidit brings his Knight out to
131.92 --> 139.92  F3 and prag brings his Knight out to C6
136.8 --> 143.08  defending now Bishop to C4 will lead to
139.92 --> 145.599  the Italian Bishop to B5 will lead to
143.08 --> 150.16000000000003  the Spanish there's also a possibility
145.599 --> 154.07999999999998  of scotch with D4 VI it plays Bishop B5
150.16 --> 157.44  we are in the Spanish territory
154.08 --> 161.31900000000002  now and prag pushes the bishop away
157.44 --> 163.07999999999998  Bishop take C6 is the ru Lopez exchange
161.319 --> 166.28  but I think most likely the bishop is
163.08 --> 170.239  going to drop back on A4 yes that's
166.28 --> 172.44  exactly what with it does now Knight F6
170.239 --> 175.519  the main move in this position then you
172.44 --> 179.599  get the bishop out to E7 or C5 and black
175.519 --> 181.56  castles prag uh takes a pause he's
179.599 --> 183.04  thinking thinking about what he wants to
181.56 --> 186.92000000000002  play and
183.04 --> 190.04  F5 oh my God what a move there by
186.92 --> 193.95899999999997  prananda he's pushed his Pawn to
190.04 --> 197.72  F5 wow and suddenly the bar climbs up
193.959 --> 201.44  what a brave move by prag
197.72 --> 203.879  here well the main point here is that
201.44 --> 206.56  you are weakening this diagonal and this
203.879 --> 208.35999999999999  has not been played before and if you
206.56 --> 211.239  try to win this Pawn by the way for
208.36 --> 214.43900000000002  white then after E4 black is completely
211.239 --> 217.519  fine black is in fact doing better so
214.439 --> 222.319  white cannot take the pawn with it has
217.519 --> 225.31900000000002  to actually play D4 here now it's clear
222.319 --> 228.23899999999998  that this line is good for white but
225.319 --> 231.11999999999998  what prananda is banking on is the fact
228.239 --> 233.159  that vidit has not revised this line or
231.12 --> 236.84  maybe not even prepared it for this
233.159 --> 240.48  tournament it's a very smart choice and
236.84 --> 243.12  with it goes Pawn to D4 where well I'm
240.48 --> 245.92  sure that he's seen it at some point now
243.12 --> 248.31900000000002  remember if you take here Knight takes
245.92 --> 251.55999999999997  opening up the queen is actually very
248.319 --> 254.48  good for white so here once again black
251.56 --> 257.44  has to be careful e takes D4 is the
254.48 --> 261.239  correct move and PR takes
257.44 --> 266.16  it and if you take here Knight takes
261.239 --> 268.88  then Knight takes Queen takes C5 B5 is
266.16 --> 271.24  going to be very good for black so again
268.88 --> 274.32  vidit finds the best move he pushes the
271.24 --> 277.0  pawn this Pawn sort of moves in to the
274.32 --> 278.88  position and next move he wants to pick
277.0 --> 285.16  up this Pawn on
278.88 --> 285.15999999999997  D4 B5 played here by prag attacking the
286.44 --> 291.12  bishop and the bishop comes back to
291.28 --> 297.67999999999995  B3 Bishop B7 has been played here before
295.16 --> 300.47900000000004  as one of the main moves but I think
297.68 --> 304.88  prananda has something up his sleeve
300.479 --> 307.24  here which he has prepared Knight to A5
304.88 --> 311.0  he wants to get rid of this bishop which
307.24 --> 314.32  is an excellent piece I can't believe
311.0 --> 320.0  the risk that prananda is taking in this
314.32 --> 323.24  game with it snatches the pawn on D4 now
320.0 --> 325.919  if you are greedy and you play C5 then
323.24 --> 331.36  you are in trouble because of Bishop D5
325.919 --> 333.88  hitting the rook and then F5 hanging so
331.36 --> 336.96000000000004  brag goes Bishop to
333.88 --> 340.71999999999997  B7 and gets the bishop on the long
336.96 --> 344.31899999999996  diagonal what has prag got in return for
340.72 --> 347.08000000000004  this risky choice is making vidit think
344.319 --> 349.6  right from Moon number four and already
347.08 --> 352.0  if you look at the time withit has 1
349.6 --> 354.40000000000003  hour 30 minutes left so he's used 30
352.0 --> 357.8  minutes for his nine moves while prag
354.4 --> 359.79999999999995  has 1 hour 56 minutes so TimeWise
357.8 --> 362.0  already a small Edge and considering
359.8 --> 364.039  that there's no increment it is
362.0 --> 367.08  something quite important Knight takes
364.039 --> 370.71999999999997  B3 has been played here by
367.08 --> 372.28  prananda and now a takes
370.72 --> 375.24  B3
372.28 --> 377.919  happens The Rook opens up but notice
375.24 --> 382.16  that this bishop now is unopposed at the
377.919 --> 386.31899999999996  same time white is a pawn up here I love
382.16 --> 388.68  this move what a move amazing move and
386.319 --> 390.08000000000004  the thing is that if you now play e
388.68 --> 393.40000000000003  takes D6
390.08 --> 397.0  Queen D7 is an amazing move and by the
393.4 --> 399.67999999999995  way with it goes Queen E2 and Prague
397.0 --> 401.8  finds the best move once again Queen D7
399.68 --> 404.52  point being if you take and give a check
401.8 --> 407.039  the king simply moves away and Rook is
404.52 --> 411.52  ready to come in and that's the reason
407.039 --> 411.52  why vidit pushes his Pawn to
412.039 --> 420.96  E6 wow Pawn to E6 and now the queen can
417.039 --> 423.87899999999996  simply pop out to C6 yes he plays it
420.96 --> 425.599  Queen to C6 look at this pattery that is
423.879 --> 429.08000000000004  created on
425.599 --> 431.87899999999996  G2 with it plays Bishop G5 what a trap
429.08 --> 434.56  if you fall for it takes your check King
431.879 --> 437.72  doesn't have a square take check and a
434.56 --> 440.199  mate next move wow prag has to be
437.72 --> 444.879  careful not to get tempted by winning a
440.199 --> 446.759  pawn here on G2 he goes G6 fantastic
444.879 --> 448.52000000000004  this is a good move he's still not
446.759 --> 451.24  threatening really to take this Knight
448.52 --> 454.24  because of Queen H5 check but he may be
451.24 --> 457.319  able to do it on the next move for now
454.24 --> 459.84000000000003  vidit comes back Knight E3 and he has
457.319 --> 462.599  defended his G2
459.84 --> 465.87899999999996  Pawn let's take stock of the
462.599 --> 468.479  situation vidit is currently a pawn up
465.879 --> 471.159  as white but what does black have in
468.479 --> 473.96  return black has the bishop pair and the
471.159 --> 476.52  E6 Pawn is slightly weak and also if you
473.96 --> 478.4  can long Castle your king will be safe
476.52 --> 481.75899999999996  mainly because even if the a file is
478.4 --> 485.35999999999996  open the bishop on B7 is an unopposed
481.759 --> 487.159  Bishop viit comes back to F4 a good
485.36 --> 490.639  Square for his Bishop he could have also
487.159 --> 492.44  come back to H4 by the way that was also
490.639 --> 497.199  fine and
492.44 --> 497.199  now prag brings his Knight to
497.479 --> 503.599  E7 the Knight is well placed blockading
500.8 --> 506.44  the pawn bishop can go to G7 then black
503.599 --> 509.56  has the option between short Castle long
506.44 --> 512.159  Castle what he wherever he wants to put
509.56 --> 515.64  his King and I love with its next move
512.159 --> 517.88  C4 he wants to gain some space next move
515.64 --> 521.68  Knight is coming to
517.88 --> 524.8  C3 and what will PR do B4 I love this
521.68 --> 527.2399999999999  move once again Knight is denied of
524.8 --> 530.279  these two good squares to come for
527.24 --> 535.04  himself so he has to play his Knight to
530.279 --> 538.8  D2 to F3 perhaps and you can see that
535.04 --> 541.36  prag is having a Time Edge 1 hour 10
538.8 --> 543.88  minutes on the clock with it has 32
541.36 --> 548.9590000000001  minutes and we have we are only on move
543.88 --> 553.279  number 17 so the pressure is slowly my
548.959 --> 555.1199999999999  mounting Queen to C5 played and I think
553.279 --> 558.079  this is mainly against the move Knight
555.12 --> 561.64  D5 because now if you play Knight D5 I
558.079 --> 564.959  can snatch it with the bishop here with
561.64 --> 566.88  it castles it out he puts his King on G1
564.959 --> 570.0  although it's slightly under pressure
566.88 --> 572.6  there with G5 H5 coming up in future
570.0 --> 574.92  it's very concrete Play Bishop G7
572.6 --> 576.6  attacking the pawn on B2 but it's not
574.92 --> 578.8  really a very important Pawn because
576.6 --> 582.9590000000001  when it's taken you can always go Rook
578.8 --> 586.24  A2 so Knight comes out to D2 now castles
582.959 --> 588.4799999999999  is the best move here shot castles but
586.24 --> 591.48  long castle by prananda this is a
588.48 --> 596.6  mistake because now VI it can jump here
591.48 --> 599.0790000000001  takes E7 here take Queen takes D5 Knight
596.6 --> 602.36  C4 Queen F5 and a very important move
599.079 --> 605.5999999999999  Queen G3 to take here take here with a
602.36 --> 608.12  fork incoming and can with it find this
605.6 --> 611.399  move Knight D5 it's an important move
608.12 --> 615.0  which will give him the edge no he plays
611.399 --> 618.24  H4 it's not the best move and actually
615.0 --> 621.56  prananda is back in the driver's
618.24 --> 625.04  seat he plays Rook d8 which is a nice
621.56 --> 628.1199999999999  move improving the position of the rook
625.04 --> 630.92  and now vid it quickly brings his Rook
628.12 --> 633.2  to D1 you can see with moving swiftly
630.92 --> 636.8389999999999  because he has only 18 minutes left
633.2 --> 639.639  prananda has 40 minutes left left and
636.839 --> 641.72  this is modern Chess at its best black
639.639 --> 644.12  has now regained his Pawn if you
641.72 --> 647.639  remember he was a pawn down but with
644.12 --> 652.24  Bishop B2 he has equalized the material
647.639 --> 652.24  that is there and the Knight jumps into
653.2 --> 659.48  D5 the Knight is well placed and if you
657.519 --> 662.6  now take I think taking might be the the
659.48 --> 664.5600000000001  best he takes and if you take back with
662.6 --> 667.72  the pawn I'm going to take it Bishop
664.56 --> 670.3199999999999  takes so with it is he going to play an
667.72 --> 672.12  interm medzo no he first takes on D5
670.32 --> 674.9200000000001  which is the correct
672.12 --> 677.36  move Queen takes D5 would be met with
674.92 --> 679.959  Knight C4 attacking this bishop and the
677.36 --> 684.6  queen which would be very strong so prag
679.959 --> 687.76  now takes on D5 from being a pawn up now
684.6 --> 690.0790000000001  with it is a pawn down but in return He
687.76 --> 693.3199999999999  has opened up the position
690.079 --> 695.92  he wants to push his Pawn he plays E7
693.32 --> 698.48  maybe Rook F E1 was a better move just
695.92 --> 701.079  defending the pawn E7 check although is
698.48 --> 703.6800000000001  very very tempting because now the king
701.079 --> 707.8389999999999  is attacked and if you play by the way
703.68 --> 711.12  King B7 there is Bishop E3 uh which is a
707.839 --> 713.36  very good move and gives an advant is
711.12 --> 716.16  fine for white but King B8 nice move
713.36 --> 718.5600000000001  there by prag Bishop E3 played by vidit
716.16 --> 723.04  12 minutes prag has 30 minutes on the
718.56 --> 725.079  clock and we are on move number 255 just
723.04 --> 727.4399999999999  remember there's no increment until move
725.079 --> 730.68  number 40 so the players have to speed
727.44 --> 733.9590000000001  up Queen B5 played and what is with it
730.68 --> 737.399  going to do next isn't he losing his E7
733.959 --> 741.079  Pawn well he decides to go to Knight C4
737.399 --> 744.24  to attack here and now if Bishop takes
741.079 --> 746.76  C4 then Pawn takes attacks the queen and
744.24 --> 751.16  white would be better so prag takes the
746.76 --> 751.16  time to defend his Bishop with Bishop
751.56 --> 758.4799999999999  C3 and Bishop comes to D4 it's a very
755.399 --> 761.6  good move by vidit now Rook at7 is the
758.48 --> 764.279  best move that's because you want to
761.6 --> 769.5600000000001  attack the E7 pawn and let's say after
764.279 --> 772.4399999999999  take take take you can go Rook E7 let's
769.56 --> 775.0  see what prug did he actually went to G8
772.44 --> 777.6800000000001  which is also a fine move but now vidit
775.0 --> 780.6  can take Pawn takes and there's this
777.68 --> 783.399  very cute little Moon kn A3 with the
780.6 --> 786.0  idea of Rook D4 to B4 which would be
783.399 --> 788.76  very powerful can with it find this Moon
786.0 --> 790.88  Knight A3 it's not at all an easy move
788.76 --> 793.92  it's also a backward move no he doesn't
790.88 --> 796.68  find it he plays Queen D4 which is also
793.92 --> 799.36  playable now the bishop is hanging so
796.68 --> 801.92  that is an important
799.36 --> 805.04  moment the bishop has to be saved and
801.92 --> 807.24  Bishop A8 is a good move by prag because
805.04 --> 810.04  if you put your Bishop there well he
807.24 --> 813.279  plays Bishop B7 and with it snatches the
810.04 --> 814.16  pawn now with Knight A5 the bishop can
813.279 --> 818.24  be
814.16 --> 821.639  attacked so prag takes the pawn and can
818.24 --> 825.36  with it jump in with his Knight to
821.639 --> 829.279  A5 yes he plays it Knight to A5 good
825.36 --> 831.839  move the bishop If It Moves now let's
829.279 --> 834.6  say Bishop A8 there's already Rook D4
831.839 --> 835.8000000000001  with the idea of Rook B4 and there the
834.6 --> 839.639  king is very
835.8 --> 843.12  weak he plays Rook E5 but now it's just
839.639 --> 846.04  take this take this and Rook D4 with
843.12 --> 847.68  Rook B4 would be very good but in fact
846.04 --> 851.0  with it goes
847.68 --> 854.5999999999999  B4 not the best not the best I like this
851.0 --> 857.44  move G5 notice how the bishop and The
854.6 --> 861.9590000000001  Rook are angling down
857.44 --> 865.12  here if you take here I can take Rook G5
861.959 --> 867.5189999999999  and this is very very powerful so G5
865.12 --> 870.16  needs to be handled with Care by withit
867.519 --> 872.44  keep the G file closed he plays H5 which
870.16 --> 872.4399999999999  is
873.36 --> 880.839  logical and Prague goes
876.279 --> 885.079  G4 wow he's attacking the H5 pawn and
880.839 --> 888.44  next G3 may also be on
885.079 --> 891.519  cards amazing play Here by prag he's
888.44 --> 894.48  showcasing why he's so good with such
891.519 --> 896.88  unconventional positions Rook H E1
894.48 --> 900.6  played and vid it is hoping that after
896.88 --> 903.24  Rook H5 he can take here on B7 and maybe
900.6 --> 907.279  get some play in the center but G3 what
903.24 --> 910.0  a move there by prananda if F3 then just
907.279 --> 913.32  Queen B6 check and followed by Rook H5
910.0 --> 916.0  is winning so he goes Knight takes B7
913.32 --> 918.839  but I think prag has an inter medo now
916.0 --> 921.32  to take on F2 with a
918.839 --> 923.24  Check Yes I think he'll play it yes
921.32 --> 927.9590000000001  check comes on the board with it takes
923.24 --> 929.9590000000001  with this King and now Queen takes on
927.959 --> 933.4799999999999  B7
929.959 --> 937.3599999999999  so you will see that G2 Pawn is under
933.48 --> 937.36  pressure with the rook and the
937.88 --> 943.319  Queen and there's no way to defend it
940.519 --> 944.16  well so you have to maybe push the pawn
943.319 --> 948.88  to
944.16 --> 951.4399999999999  G3 he plays Queen F3 but guys notice how
948.88 --> 954.48  black is a pawn up and Rook
951.44 --> 958.0  G5 awesome move because threatening Rook
954.48 --> 960.12  takes G2 and now the H5 Pawn is also
958.0 --> 962.199  weak so you would be two pawns down in
960.12 --> 966.24  The Rook end game with it takes the
962.199 --> 969.92  queen king takes and he plays Pawn to
966.24 --> 971.6  G4 well can't we just take here now
969.92 --> 973.8  isn't that possible ah he wants to go
971.6 --> 976.0790000000001  Rook e 6 and win this
973.8 --> 980.639  Pawn
976.079 --> 983.4799999999999  well BR takes on G4 Rook comes into E6
980.639 --> 986.399  you will see that 40th move has now been
983.48 --> 989.44  reached 30 seconds were left and now the
986.399 --> 992.759  players have to write down their moves
989.44 --> 996.6800000000001  with prananda goes Rook
992.759 --> 1000.44  H4 and he is attacking the pawn here so
996.68 --> 1003.88  if white takes here black will go Rook
1000.44 --> 1008.9200000000001  G5 and Round Up This
1003.88 --> 1012.6  Pawn so withit in spite of playing so
1008.92 --> 1014.279  well now has been outplayed by prananda
1012.6 --> 1017.0  I think prag just showed that he
1014.279 --> 1019.319  understood the position much better and
1017.0 --> 1023.199  that's the thing about prag he's able to
1019.319 --> 1026.6  play different positions very well and
1023.199 --> 1029.559  also taking such a risk in a game of
1026.6 --> 1032.6  such huge importance is
1029.559 --> 1035.0  insane in fact Hikaru Nakamura today was
1032.6 --> 1038.4389999999999  in similar situation like prag he had
1035.0 --> 1040.679  lost his second round game and he said
1038.439 --> 1043.0  that he made a quick draw with abaso in
1040.679 --> 1044.919  round three with black pieces he said
1043.0 --> 1047.24  that he didn't want to risk it because
1044.919 --> 1050.0800000000002  if he lost another game he was
1047.24 --> 1054.32  practically then out of the tournament
1050.08 --> 1056.28  top running um but prag has a completely
1054.32 --> 1059.84  different approach towards things he's
1056.28 --> 1062.9189999999999  like let's go if I sacrificed three
1059.84 --> 1065.799  pawns yesterday against gukesh why can't
1062.919 --> 1070.2800000000002  I do it again that's his question here
1065.799 --> 1073.6  Rook D7 played and prug is actually
1070.28 --> 1075.6789999999999  getting the Rook out from there from D7
1073.6 --> 1078.1589999999999  Rook comes to
1075.679 --> 1079.4  E7 if you are able to trade one of the
1078.159 --> 1081.919  Rooks it'll be become very
1079.4 --> 1085.6000000000001  straightforward and simple Rook E5 he
1081.919 --> 1088.4  wants to trade Rook G7 played and now
1085.6 --> 1090.3999999999999  next move you can go Rook check when the
1088.4 --> 1092.72  king comes to the G file you can play
1090.4 --> 1096.159  Rook G5 trade one of the Rooks put the
1092.72 --> 1098.84  Rook on B5 and slowly bring your king up
1096.159 --> 1102.64  and it is game over vidit resigns
1098.84 --> 1106.32  prananda manages to beat vidit what a
1102.64 --> 1108.76  game this was and really hats off to
1106.32 --> 1111.6  prag for his opening Choice what a bold
1108.76 --> 1115.84  opening choice and I really love how
1111.6 --> 1119.1589999999999  vidit has started analyzing here uh he
1115.84 --> 1121.6  lost the game but it's very important
1119.159 --> 1124.5200000000002  for him to know where he could have
1121.6 --> 1128.799  improved as a player for now prag
1124.52 --> 1133.039  reaches 50% score withit also on 50%
1128.799 --> 1133.039  this tournament is shaping up
1137.72 --> 1140.72  well
1142.88 --> 1145.2800000000002  your
1167.72 --> 1170.72  mind
