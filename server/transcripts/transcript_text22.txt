0.3 --> 2.04  - Could black holes be the key
2.04 --> 4.890000000000001  to a quantum theory of gravity?
4.89 --> 9.89  A deeper theory of how reality,
of how space and time works?
12.15 --> 14.31  Black holes are interesting
14.31 --> 17.580000000000002  because we have a place
called the 'event horizon'
17.58 --> 21.779999999999998  where we think that we have
full control of the physics.
21.78 --> 23.76  We understand what's happening,
23.76 --> 27.090000000000003  but there is a fundamental clash
27.09 --> 30.489  between our two basic theories of nature:
30.489 --> 35.489000000000004  both quantum theory and
general relativity together.
35.79 --> 40.32  And the quest to unify
those two great pillars
40.32 --> 43.08  of 20th- and 21st-century physics
43.08 --> 45.071  into what's often referred to as
45.071 --> 46.171  'a quantum theory of gravity'
46.171 --> 49.803  is in some sense the holy grail
to theoretical physicists.
51.33 --> 53.339999999999996  So black holes are forcing us
53.34 --> 56.31  into a deeper understanding
of what space and time are.
56.31 --> 60.03  And in that sense, I
think it is fair to say
60.03 --> 64.713  that black holes are the keys
to understanding the Universe.
66.48 --> 67.5  I'm Brian Cox,
67.5 --> 69.45  I am a professor of particle physics
69.45 --> 70.89  at the University of Manchester,
70.89 --> 72.87  and the Royal Society Professor
72.87 --> 74.97  for Public Engagement in Science,
74.97 --> 76.08  and amongst other things
76.08 --> 77.527  I'm the author of the book,
77.527 --> 80.607  "Black Holes: The Key to
Understanding the Universe."
89.55 --> 92.46  The idea of black holes goes
back a long way actually,
92.46 --> 95.1  back into the 1780s and 1790s.
95.1 --> 99.14999999999999  There were two physicists, mathematicians,
99.15 --> 101.28  natural philosophers, whatever
you want to call them,
101.28 --> 104.22  working at the time
that had the same idea,
104.22 --> 106.89  apparently independently of each other.
106.89 --> 109.02  One was a clergyman called Mitchell
109.02 --> 112.44  and the other was the great
French mathematician, Laplace.
112.44 --> 113.85  And they were both thinking
113.85 --> 117.235  in terms of an idea
called 'escape velocity.'
117.235 --> 120.33  The escape velocity is the
speed you have to travel
120.33 --> 123.36  to completely escape the
gravitational pull of something,
123.36 --> 125.13  a planet or a star.
125.13 --> 126.83999999999999  So for the Earth, for example,
126.84 --> 130.084  the escape velocity from
the surface of the Earth
130.084 --> 133.25900000000001  is around eight miles a second.
133.259 --> 137.48999999999998  If you go bigger, you make a
bigger, more massive thing,
137.49 --> 140.34  let's go to a star, for
example, like the Sun,
140.34 --> 144.27  it's somewhere in the region
of 400 miles a second.
144.27 --> 145.95000000000002  The escape velocity increases
145.95 --> 149.1  because the gravitational
pull at the surface increases.
149.1 --> 150.69  What Mitchell and Laplace thought,
150.69 --> 152.25  and I think it's a very beautiful idea,
152.25 --> 153.96  is they imagined in their mind's eye,
153.96 --> 156.27  "Well, can you go bigger?
156.27 --> 159.21  Can you imagine more
and more massive stars,
159.21 --> 163.53  giant stars such that
the gravitational pull
163.53 --> 165.6  is so large at the surface
165.6 --> 168.513  that the escape velocity
exceeds the speed of light?"
169.35 --> 171.263  And then you wouldn't be able to see them.
174.87 --> 176.46  To understand why black holes
176.46 --> 178.98000000000002  cause so many conceptual problems,
178.98 --> 182.1  it might be worth just
describing very, very briefly
182.1 --> 183.753  what a black hole looks like.
184.86 --> 187.71300000000002  So a black hole, what do
you see from the outside?
189.0 --> 192.78  Well, there's an event horizon
surrounding the black hole.
192.78 --> 195.36  In some sense, it defines the boundary
195.36 --> 197.19000000000003  between the external universe
197.19 --> 199.698  and the interior of the black hole.
199.698 --> 201.88  And if you go across the boundary
201.88 --> 204.9  into the interior of this sphere,
204.9 --> 207.93  then even if you can travel
as fast as the speed of light,
207.93 --> 211.35  you can't escape the gravitational
pull of the black hole.
211.35 --> 213.213  But another description
of the event horizon
213.213 --> 215.2  which confused people
216.27 --> 218.88000000000002  all the way through the
history of black hole research
218.88 --> 222.35999999999999  actually, was the idea
that the event horizon
222.36 --> 224.387  when viewed from the outside
224.387 --> 228.45  is a place in space where time stops.
228.45 --> 231.03  And that's a direct prediction
231.03 --> 232.83  of Einstein's theory of relativity.
232.83 --> 235.23000000000002  From the external perspective,
235.23 --> 237.20999999999998  there is a central problem though
237.21 --> 239.43  which is still not solved,
239.43 --> 243.603  which is what lies at the
center of a black hole?
248.22 --> 251.22  You might think of it as
an infinitely dense point
251.22 --> 254.4  to which this massive star collapses.
254.4 --> 255.51000000000002  So what are we picturing?
255.51 --> 258.03  It's this thing called the 'singularity.'
258.03 --> 260.34  Actually, it's not right to talk
260.34 --> 263.21999999999997  about the center of a black hole really.
263.22 --> 265.83000000000004  Just even in pure general relativity,
265.83 --> 267.9  when you look at a nice
map of a black hole,
267.9 --> 271.40999999999997  a so-called 'Penrose diagram'
named after Roger Penrose,
271.41 --> 274.629  what you see is that space
and time is so distorted,
274.629 --> 279.15000000000003  that in some sense, their roles swap,
279.15 --> 283.65  the singularity is not really
a place in space at all,
283.65 --> 288.65  it's a moment in time, and
actually it's the end of time.
289.05 --> 293.01  But the nature of that thing was not
293.01 --> 295.413  and is still not understood,
296.25 --> 298.5  and for many, many years actually
298.5 --> 301.26  until quite recently, then people thought,
301.26 --> 302.19  "Well, there we are,
302.19 --> 303.96  we have a problem with the singularity.
303.96 --> 305.90999999999997  We don't really have any access to it.
305.91 --> 309.12  We don't have the conceptual
tools to explore it.
309.12 --> 312.84000000000003  So it may remain a mystery
for a century to come;
312.84 --> 314.493  it is not clear what to do.
315.36 --> 319.35  The great revolution
in black hole research
319.35 --> 323.73  was to notice that actually
there are conceptual problems,
323.73 --> 326.64000000000004  not only in this extreme
place at the singularity,
326.64 --> 330.223  whatever that might
be, but at the horizon.
343.29 --> 348.283  What Stephen Hawking showed
in a landmark couple of papers
348.283 --> 353.283  is that if you consider quantum
theory, quantum mechanics
353.91 --> 356.88000000000005  in the vicinity of the
horizon of a black hole
356.88 --> 359.90999999999997  then you find that they glow,
359.91 --> 364.91  they produce particles,
they have a temperature.
364.98 --> 367.47  This thing that we've pictured
367.47 --> 370.44000000000005  in Einstein's theory is pure geometry,
370.44 --> 375.44  just distorted space and time
actually emits particles-
376.17 --> 378.12  it's called Hawking radiation.
378.12 --> 381.3  And Stephen, in his 1974 paper,
381.3 --> 383.1  gives this hand-wavy description-
383.1 --> 386.31  which is kind of a nice way
to picture what's happening-
386.31 --> 388.424  the idea is to zoom in
388.424 --> 392.7  in the vicinity of the event
horizon of a black hole.
392.7 --> 395.07  You can picture what's happening
395.07 --> 396.93  as a series of particles
396.93 --> 400.32  coming in and out of
existence all the time,
400.32 --> 403.05  so-called 'entangled particles.'
403.05 --> 406.2  And so one of those pairs of particles
406.2 --> 408.06  is on the inside of the event horizon,
408.06 --> 409.83  and one is on the outside.
409.83 --> 413.52  And then it can happen
that the one on the outside
413.52 --> 416.818  instead of merging back
with its partner again
416.818 --> 420.03  can escape into the Universe,
420.03 --> 422.94  removing energy from the
black hole as it goes;
422.94 --> 425.01  therefore, it's shrinking,
425.01 --> 427.623  which means that one day it will be gone.
430.71 --> 433.38  That has profound implications.
433.38 --> 435.51  So black holes are not eternal prisons,
435.51 --> 437.37  they have a lifetime.
437.37 --> 442.113  One day, whatever's in there
is returned to the Universe.
442.98 --> 444.33000000000004  The question was,
444.33 --> 447.35999999999996  the central question that
was immediately raised
447.36 --> 450.091  by those calculations is this:
450.091 --> 454.59000000000003  What happened to all
the stuff that fell in?
454.59 --> 455.84999999999997  The way I've described it,
455.85 --> 458.1  the way Einstein's theory describes it,
458.1 --> 460.92  is somehow that stuff
goes to the singularity,
460.92 --> 463.194  whatever that thing is, the end of time,
463.194 --> 466.8  the region of space time that's
so convoluted and distorted
466.8 --> 469.798  that we don't understand
how to describe it at all-
469.798 --> 473.88  But then one day the whole thing is gone.
473.88 --> 478.86  All that's left in the far, far
future is Hawking radiation,
478.86 --> 480.93  those particles that were produced
480.93 --> 482.943  in the vicinity of the event horizon.
483.81 --> 487.217  The question is, is it possible
487.217 --> 490.16999999999996  if you could collect all that radiation,
490.17 --> 492.45  all the Hawking radiation
through the whole life
492.45 --> 494.13  of the black hole-
494.13 --> 498.06  is it somehow possible in principle
498.06 --> 501.06  that the information about everything
501.06 --> 504.127  that fell into the black
hole throughout its history
504.127 --> 508.77  is imprinted in that
radiation in the far future?
508.77 --> 511.77  Is that true or is it not true?
511.77 --> 513.99  You might say, why did
I ask that question?
513.99 --> 516.27  Seems like a bit of a random question.
516.27 --> 518.5799999999999  It's a very important question.
518.58 --> 523.58  Information is conserved in
the Universe as far as we know.
524.31 --> 526.2299999999999  So every law of nature that we have
526.23 --> 528.57  says that information is conserved.
528.57 --> 531.36  So let's say that I take a book
531.36 --> 534.39  and I set fire to it, I incinerate it,
534.39 --> 537.51  I destroy it in any way that I can.
537.51 --> 540.085  In basic fundamental physics,
540.085 --> 542.01  then it turns out
542.01 --> 546.3  that if you could collect
every piece of that thing
546.3 --> 548.7299999999999  that I detonated or incinerated,
548.73 --> 552.45  every quantum of radiation,
every photon, every particle,
552.45 --> 557.07  everything, in principle, if
I could just collect it all,
557.07 --> 560.523  then I could reconstruct the
thing that I had destroyed.
561.45 --> 564.6600000000001  The problem was black holes,
564.66 --> 567.15  quantum mechanics, general relativity,
567.15 --> 568.89  when you put them together
568.89 --> 571.62  you have this apparent prediction
571.62 --> 575.43  that these things erase
information from the Universe-
575.43 --> 579.603  this became known as the 'Black
hole information paradox.'
582.21 --> 585.5400000000001  It turns out if we fast
forward to the present day
585.54 --> 588.24  and a series of papers
are still being written,
588.24 --> 591.78  so this is still research
that's happening as we speak,
591.78 --> 594.93  but it turns out now that the general view
594.93 --> 598.7399999999999  is that black holes do
not erase information
598.74 --> 600.033  from the Universe.
601.35 --> 604.4920000000001  We now think you could
collect all that radiation,
604.492 --> 609.12  and in principle, put it
into some quantum computer
609.12 --> 611.01  and reconstruct the information
611.01 --> 612.51  about everything that fell in.
613.38 --> 615.123  But the implications of that,
615.123 --> 618.75  that the mechanism by which that happens,
618.75 --> 621.93  I would say it's profoundly exciting
621.93 --> 624.03  because it really does seem to be given
624.03 --> 627.5699999999999  as a glimpse of a deeper
theory of gravity.
627.57 --> 630.21  The simple way to say it,
630.21 --> 632.64  let me say it in in one sentence:
632.64 --> 637.11  It seems that space and
time are not fundamental.
637.11 --> 640.02  So one view, and I emphasize
640.02 --> 641.13  that there are other views
641.13 --> 642.99  where the cutting edge of research now,
642.99 --> 645.8100000000001  but one view is a field
645.81 --> 649.3199999999999  which has become known
as 'emergent spacetime.'
649.32 --> 651.87  And so the idea is that space
651.87 --> 656.055  and time themselves emerge from what?
656.055 --> 659.13  From quantum entanglement,
659.13 --> 663.54  from some kind of smaller parts or pieces.
663.54 --> 665.49  We don't know what those things are.
665.49 --> 667.47  We don't know the nature of them
667.47 --> 671.13  but it does seem that there's
a deeper underlying theory
671.13 --> 672.96  from which space and time emerge.
672.96 --> 676.2330000000001  That is what we call the
'quantum theory of gravity.'
677.37 --> 678.51  And my view is that
678.51 --> 680.664  if we're gonna talk about
the origin of the Universe,
680.664 --> 683.4  even ask questions such
as did the Universe
683.4 --> 685.47  have a beginning in time,
685.47 --> 687.78  which we don't know the answer to,
687.78 --> 689.735  then it surely seems to me
689.735 --> 692.711  that we have to understand
what space and time are
692.711 --> 695.1  before we can ask
695.1 --> 697.803  and have any chance of
answering such questions.
699.21 --> 700.11  And black holes,
700.11 --> 703.89  it turns out are the
objects that we can see,
703.89 --> 707.79  that we can observe that
actually exist in nature
707.79 --> 711.48  that force us down that
route to ask questions,
711.48 --> 714.3000000000001  sharp, well-defined questions actually,
714.3 --> 716.703  about the nature of space
and time themselves.
718.47 --> 723.0  Einstein said that if you look
at nature really carefully
723.0 --> 725.52  and keep pulling at the
intellectual threads
725.52 --> 728.864  and keep going and just keep delving down
728.864 --> 732.24  into what nature seems
to be trying to tell us,
732.24 --> 735.36  then if you're lucky and persistent,
735.36 --> 738.99  you can catch a glimpse of
something deeply hidden.
738.99 --> 740.04  It's beautiful that, isn't it?
740.04 --> 742.17  A glimpse of something deeply hidden,
742.17 --> 744.87  which is the deep underlying
structure of nature,
744.87 --> 747.8100000000001  the deep underlying
structure of reality itself.
747.81 --> 749.16  And I think it's very beautiful.
749.16 --> 750.411  No one really knows,
750.411 --> 753.4119999999999  I think it's fair to
say, where this is going,
753.412 --> 756.4530000000001  but that hints of something deeply hidden.
