0.08 --> 3.08  foreign
21.279 --> 26.72  what's wrong tofu
24.16 --> 29.519  i can't sleep
26.72 --> 30.4  would a bedtime story help
29.519 --> 33.039  yeah
30.4 --> 33.039  i guess
36.32 --> 40.36  the ugly duckling
55.28 --> 61.44  once near a beautiful pond there lived a
58.719 --> 64.32000000000001  handsome duck couple
61.44 --> 69.03999999999999  they were very excited as the babies
64.32 --> 69.03999999999999  were about to get hatched from the eggs
69.119 --> 75.92  the papa duck was so eager to see his
72.24 --> 80.15899999999999  babies that all he could do was roam
75.92 --> 80.159  here and there in anxiety
84.88 --> 91.36  suddenly what they hear is sweet little
88.08 --> 94.24  quack quacks coming from the nest and
91.36 --> 98.72  the papa duck just rushes to the nest to
94.24 --> 98.72  catch the first glimpse of his babies
99.439 --> 105.27999999999999  oh my god
101.52 --> 105.28  they are so lovely
108.32 --> 115.39899999999999  suddenly a whole squat comes from below
111.92 --> 115.399  mama duck
128.239 --> 135.68  you are so ugly and pale
131.599 --> 135.67999999999998  you can't be our baby
137.599 --> 143.28  the papa and mama duck along with the
140.56 --> 146.56  four babies sail away
143.28 --> 152.08  far away from the ugly duckling leaving
146.56 --> 152.08  him behind in dismay and all alone
152.879 --> 158.239  the poor duckling doesn't know what's
155.44 --> 158.239  wrong with him
158.56 --> 162.08  he checks his wings
160.56 --> 163.519  his beak
162.08 --> 166.0  his feet
163.519 --> 168.959  but all looks fine
166.0 --> 171.44  suddenly he turns around and sees his
168.959 --> 174.48  reflection in the pond
171.44 --> 177.48  and what he sees sends him complete
174.48 --> 177.48  disappointment
178.72 --> 184.72  nobody loves me
181.04 --> 187.35999999999999  what would i do now where would i go
184.72 --> 189.599  the ugly duckling starts walking in
187.36 --> 191.36  complete sadness
189.599 --> 195.11999999999998  so many days
191.36 --> 198.959  weeks and months pass by and the poor
195.12 --> 202.0  ugly duckling wanders all alone in the
198.959 --> 202.0  deep forest
202.72 --> 208.72  suddenly
203.84 --> 208.72  he stops and feels extremely cold
210.799 --> 217.28  it is so cool
212.64 --> 217.27999999999997  i wish i had a warm house too
219.519 --> 225.44  suddenly a huge ball of snow comes
222.72 --> 228.319  rolling from behind and the poor
225.44 --> 231.28  duckling gets caught in that and starts
228.319 --> 233.92  screaming for help
231.28 --> 236.72  a wood cutter cutting the woods in a
233.92 --> 241.39999999999998  nearby place hears the screen of the
236.72 --> 241.4  duckling and runs for help
245.92 --> 249.439  oh poor thing
248.159 --> 253.12  come here
249.439 --> 255.599  you need something warm to drink
253.12 --> 258.639  the wood cut up picks up the ugly
255.599 --> 260.799  duckling and keeps him in the warmth of
258.639 --> 264.16  his overcoat
260.799 --> 267.19899999999996  he takes him home and keeps him wrapped
264.16 --> 269.44  in a warm blanket right in front of the
267.199 --> 272.16  fireplace
269.44 --> 275.199  don't worry poor little thing i will
272.16 --> 275.199  take care of you
276.32 --> 282.96  and like this many years pass by and the
279.919 --> 285.68  ugly duckling grew under the care of the
282.96 --> 285.68  woodcutter
289.6 --> 297.72  but one thing he made sure
292.16 --> 297.72  never did he see his reflection again
303.52 --> 310.56  one day on a sunny afternoon he was
307.12 --> 311.68  wandering around the sides of a lake
310.56 --> 315.12  suddenly
311.68 --> 317.6  he sees a wedge of swans swimming in the
315.12 --> 317.6  pond
318.639 --> 323.28000000000003  look at those swans they are so
321.919 --> 326.79999999999995  beautiful
323.28 --> 331.67999999999995  i wish i was a beautiful duck too
326.8 --> 334.8  i have no friends because i'm so ugly
331.68 --> 337.84000000000003  i feel oh so lonely
334.8 --> 341.12  to his amazement he sees the wedge of
337.84 --> 344.96  swans coming towards him
341.12 --> 346.4  what he sees is the most beautiful swan
344.96 --> 347.59999999999997  ever
346.4 --> 350.32  hey
347.6 --> 353.12  we have never seen you around
350.32 --> 356.96  are you here
353.12 --> 360.479  no i live nearby with the woodcutter
356.96 --> 363.039  it's just that i don't come out often
360.479 --> 368.08  why is that so
363.039 --> 371.199  because i'm an ugly cup nobody loves me
368.08 --> 371.199  nobody wants me
372.08 --> 376.639  not to his surprise he sees them
374.72 --> 379.759  laughing at him
376.639 --> 383.28000000000003  he decides to turn back when suddenly he
379.759 --> 386.24  hears the voice of the beautiful swan
383.28 --> 389.75899999999996  wait where are you going
386.24 --> 393.44  see even you guys made fun of me that's
389.759 --> 395.84000000000003  the reason i never come out
393.44 --> 397.36  we laughed because you call yourself a
395.84 --> 399.11999999999995  duck
397.36 --> 400.08000000000004  what do you mean
399.12 --> 403.36  yes
400.08 --> 406.639  you are not a duck you are a swan
403.36 --> 409.759  and i haven't seen such a handsome swan
406.639 --> 411.599  ever in my life he couldn't believe of
409.759 --> 415.28000000000003  what he just heard
411.599 --> 417.36  and stood there in a state of shock
415.28 --> 419.039  and after a few seconds
417.36 --> 420.88  managed to say
419.039 --> 423.52  what
420.88 --> 426.4  the beautiful swan held the hand of the
423.52 --> 429.28  duck and took him near the pond
426.4 --> 431.84  see yourself
429.28 --> 435.11999999999995  you are a swan
431.84 --> 437.52  the ugly duckling very reluctantly bends
435.12 --> 439.84000000000003  over the water because he doesn't want
437.52 --> 443.19899999999996  to see the ugly him
439.84 --> 444.79999999999995  but what he sees leaves him in total
443.199 --> 447.12  disbelief
444.8 --> 452.639  he is not a duck
447.12 --> 452.639  he is a swan a handsome young swan
453.28 --> 456.479  i am a swan
457.52 --> 462.96  he jumps and flies
459.84 --> 465.75899999999996  and swims in sheer happiness and then
462.96 --> 467.599  suddenly stops to thank the beautiful
465.759 --> 470.40000000000003  swan
467.599 --> 472.8  thank you so much for making me know who
470.4 --> 472.79999999999995  i am
472.879 --> 477.52000000000004  so now that you know you are a swan
475.52 --> 481.44  would you join a wedge
477.52 --> 482.479  we would live together as a happy family
481.44 --> 485.199  yes
482.479 --> 488.4  i would love to do that
485.199 --> 490.0  and then the ugly duckling oops the
488.4 --> 492.4  handsome swan
490.0 --> 495.12  jumps into the water with the rest of
492.4 --> 495.12  the swans
497.36 --> 502.28000000000003  and swims proudly with them
509.52 --> 516.0799999999999  so the poor duck was never a duck
512.56 --> 516.0799999999999  a swan all throughout
516.56 --> 519.8389999999999  yeah
517.519 --> 521.039  and that's what the moral of the story
519.839 --> 523.6800000000001  is
521.039 --> 525.519  a diamond doesn't know its worth till
523.68 --> 526.64  it's polished
525.519 --> 532.04  aha
526.64 --> 532.04  good night tofu it's time to sleep now
540.88 --> 543.88  so
565.839 --> 569.44  slow
567.12 --> 573.48  and steady
569.44 --> 573.48  wins the race
581.279 --> 588.0  slow and steady
584.64 --> 588.0  wins the race
589.12 --> 594.32  what happened tofu
591.36 --> 598.08  what is it that you're thinking
594.32 --> 601.839  yes tia i am not able to understand how
598.08 --> 602.839  can a person win the race if he's slow
601.839 --> 605.7600000000001  and yet
602.839 --> 607.2790000000001  steady there is a very famous story
605.76 --> 610.24  behind this
607.279 --> 612.64  should i tell you that first
610.24 --> 612.64  sure
614.16 --> 618.36  the hair and the tortoise
619.839 --> 626.9590000000001  long ago in a forest
623.839 --> 630.519  a small get-together of animals was
626.959 --> 630.5189999999999  taking place
635.44 --> 641.6800000000001  you know what
636.959 --> 641.68  i can beat anyone in this forest
641.76 --> 646.68  nobody can beat me in a race
655.36 --> 660.64  yes
656.32 --> 667.12  i have seen him running
660.64 --> 667.12  i bet he can beat anyone in this forest
668.079 --> 674.5999999999999  suddenly from the crowd they hear
670.88 --> 674.6  somebody laughing
679.839 --> 683.12  why are you laughing
683.6 --> 688.6800000000001  you think you can beat me in a race
688.88 --> 694.24  i may not disagree with you or mr hare
694.64 --> 702.519  but i might not deny that i have no fear
698.24 --> 702.519  of competing with you
705.12 --> 709.92  oh really
706.48 --> 712.9200000000001  so let's have a race and let's see who
709.92 --> 712.92  wins
725.44 --> 732.8000000000001  so one fine sunny day
728.079 --> 732.8  all the animals gathered for the race
736.16 --> 744.6  everybody was sure that the hare is
739.519 --> 744.6  gonna be a clear-cut winner
752.639 --> 755.639  hahaha
759.68 --> 764.3199999999999  may the best man win
762.56 --> 768.3599999999999  and that is me
764.32 --> 768.36  set the hair proudly
775.04 --> 781.959  now let's go old man i'll beat you in a
778.959 --> 781.959  second
795.279 --> 802.88  the hair runs so fast that all the
798.48 --> 802.88  things on the path go for a spin
813.6 --> 817.44  on the other hand the tortoise is
816.0 --> 820.48  running too
817.44 --> 824.5600000000001  but at such a pace that even snails
820.48 --> 824.5600000000001  could pass by him easily
826.88 --> 832.0  suddenly the hair stops and looks behind
836.16 --> 841.04  oh my lord
838.0 --> 843.839  that tortoise is gonna take ages to
841.04 --> 843.8389999999999  reach this point
845.6 --> 850.399  so let's just stop here and take some
848.56 --> 853.5189999999999  rest
850.399 --> 856.639  by the time he reaches here i would get
853.519 --> 860.36  good rest and then cover him up in a
856.639 --> 860.36  blink of a second
871.199 --> 876.56  in the meanwhile
873.199 --> 880.399  the tortoise slowly and steadily reaches
876.56 --> 884.399  the point where the hair is fast asleep
880.399 --> 887.44  he very quietly tiptoes past the hair
884.399 --> 890.44  and the hair is all ignorant of this
887.44 --> 890.44  fact
900.8 --> 907.68  suddenly the hair gets up by the rows of
904.16 --> 912.68  the crowd cheering up the toy toys go
907.68 --> 912.68  toys go go tour toys
920.079 --> 926.6389999999999  oh my lord how is that possible i kept
923.92 --> 931.4399999999999  on sleeping for so long that the
926.639 --> 931.44  tortoise is about to finish the race
932.8 --> 937.279  he runs and runs and runs
937.759 --> 944.32  but to his disappointment the tortoise
941.12 --> 947.5600000000001  just manages to finish the race before
944.32 --> 947.5600000000001  he could
966.0 --> 970.88  in the story
967.44 --> 973.519  the hare was so full of himself
970.88 --> 976.88  he was overconfident that he would
973.519 --> 979.12  surely beat the tortoise in the race
976.88 --> 983.36  because he is faster than that poor
979.12 --> 984.759  being in every other way but
983.36 --> 987.12  but the hair
984.759 --> 991.1990000000001  underestimated the tortoise and
987.12 --> 992.5600000000001  succumbed in his own fake overconfidence
991.199 --> 996.0  yes
992.56 --> 999.1199999999999  and that's why only a person who thinks
996.0 --> 1002.959  calmly and is not over confident of
999.12 --> 1005.36  himself wins the race in every sphere of
1002.959 --> 1008.959  life
1005.36 --> 1011.839  proud people can't survive for long
1008.959 --> 1011.8389999999999  hmm
1032.319 --> 1036.72  what happened why can't you sleep
1035.28 --> 1039.12  i don't know
1036.72 --> 1041.439  can you please put me off to sleep by
1039.12 --> 1044.079  telling me a story
1041.439 --> 1047.199  sure tofu i'll tell you one of my
1044.079 --> 1047.1989999999998  favorite story
1049.6 --> 1053.84  the little red riding hood
1056.88 --> 1063.7600000000002  little red riding hood lived in a hut
1059.679 --> 1063.76  near a forest with her mother
1064.0 --> 1070.4  she always wore a beautiful red hood
1067.28 --> 1075.28  while going out
1070.4 --> 1075.2800000000002  one day she went to see her grandmother
1079.28 --> 1084.0  on her face
1080.72 --> 1084.0  she met a wolf

1089.6 --> 1095.52  i am going to see my granny
1092.32 --> 1099.84  she lives behind that hill
1095.52 --> 1099.84  the wolf got a wicked idea
1104.08 --> 1108.84  the wolf ran to granny's house
1125.2 --> 1130.96  and ate her up
1126.96 --> 1130.96  and got into granny's bed
1134.64 --> 1141.5200000000002  after some time
1136.559 --> 1141.52  little red riding hood reached the house
1141.679 --> 1146.88  she saw the wolf lying in her granny's
1144.559 --> 1146.8799999999999  bed

1193.039 --> 1199.679  he ran to the house just to see the wolf
1196.0 --> 1199.679  attacking the little girl
1200.559 --> 1205.44  he hit the wolf
1202.64 --> 1208.5590000000002  over the head and this made the wolf
1205.44 --> 1211.039  open his mouth and shout
1208.559 --> 1213.9189999999999  the granny jumped out
1211.039 --> 1219.24  the wolf ran away and the little red
1213.919 --> 1219.24  riding hood never saw the wolf again
1226.96 --> 1233.6000000000001  so tofu little red riding hood was able
1230.48 --> 1235.84  to save herself and her old grandmother

1322.48 --> 1328.4  five rupees caps 10 rupees caps
1326.0 --> 1331.12  caps caps
1328.4 --> 1334.3200000000002  he was going through a forest
1331.12 --> 1336.8799999999999  he was carrying a basket of red caps on
1334.32 --> 1336.8799999999999  his head
1339.679 --> 1347.2800000000002  he got tired in the heat of the sun
1344.48 --> 1348.88  and thought of lying down under a tree
1347.28 --> 1353.039  for some time
1348.88 --> 1353.0390000000002  he put his basket on the ground
1355.12 --> 1361.32  i am so tired let me take a small nap
1364.96 --> 1369.4  there were monkeys on that tree
1384.0 --> 1387.72  they came down
1396.0 --> 1400.4  and one by one
1397.679 --> 1403.4  took all the caps from the cap seller's
1400.4 --> 1403.4  basket
1412.48 --> 1417.08  then they climbed on the tree
1418.0 --> 1423.039  when the cap seller woke up he was
1420.32 --> 1427.12  shocked to see his basket empty
1423.039 --> 1430.08  he searched for his caps everywhere
1427.12 --> 1432.799  to his surprise he saw the monkeys for
1430.08 --> 1432.799  wearing them
1434.72 --> 1439.52  he found that the monkeys were imitating
1437.279 --> 1439.52  him
1443.039 --> 1447.44  so he started
1444.4 --> 1450.0800000000002  throwing his cap down and the monkeys
1447.44 --> 1450.0800000000002  did so
1450.559 --> 1457.12  the cap seller collected all the caps
1453.76 --> 1460.64  put them back in his basket
1457.12 --> 1460.6399999999999  and went away happily
1467.36 --> 1473.9189999999999  so tofu we should deal with cleverness
1470.64 --> 1477.96  in such situations because wisdom helps
1473.919 --> 1477.96  during difficult times
1503.6 --> 1508.6399999999999  tofu i think you should help the poor

1512.84 --> 1517.52  story the lion and the mouse
1523.12 --> 1530.7199999999998  one day a lion was sleeping in his den
1527.279 --> 1533.679  a mouse was also playing nearby
1530.72 --> 1535.2  little mouse began running up and down
1533.679 --> 1538.159  upon him
1535.2 --> 1540.88  this soon awakened the lion
1538.159 --> 1543.279  angry at the little mouse the lion
1540.88 --> 1544.3200000000002  caught the mouse and said you little
1543.279 --> 1546.799  mouse

1549.84 --> 1554.1589999999999  and prayed to the lion
1552.64 --> 1556.7990000000002  father no king

1562.64 --> 1566.96  life
1563.679 --> 1570.48  the lion was rather amused to hear this
1566.96 --> 1573.2  thinking what good can he do to me but
1570.48 --> 1573.2  let him go
1578.88 --> 1582.8400000000001  a few days after the lion was walking in
1582.0 --> 1585.679  a
1582.84 --> 1589.4399999999998  jungle he found himself
1585.679 --> 1592.3200000000002  caught in a hunter's net he roared and
1589.44 --> 1595.3200000000002  rolled to get out of the net but he
1592.32 --> 1595.32  failed
1598.32 --> 1603.039  the lion was pleading for help
1601.84 --> 1605.6  help me
1603.039 --> 1605.6  help me
1605.679 --> 1611.679  the mouse whose life was saved by the
1608.32 --> 1614.1589999999999  lion heard the roar and ran to the lion
1611.679 --> 1614.159  and said
1616.96 --> 1624.08  don't worry my friend i will save you
1621.52 --> 1627.32  the mouse gathered all his friends and
1624.08 --> 1627.32  told them
1627.36 --> 1632.4799999999998  we all have to help my friend and set
1629.84 --> 1632.48  him free
1634.559 --> 1641.72  the mouse and his friends cut through
1636.559 --> 1641.72  the net and set the lion free
1641.84 --> 1648.1589999999999  the lion escaped and thanked the mouse
1646.559 --> 1652.24  and from that day
1648.159 --> 1652.24  they became the best of friends
1653.039 --> 1658.559  like the little mouse and lion had
1655.36 --> 1660.1589999999999  become friends and in the end
1658.559 --> 1663.2  helped each other

1716.24 --> 1720.32  goldilocks and the three bears
1721.679 --> 1727.52  once upon a time there was a little girl
1725.039 --> 1730.72  named goldilocks
1727.52 --> 1733.2  she had golden hair
1730.72 --> 1737.72  one morning she was walking in the
1733.2 --> 1737.72  forest and lost her way
1738.159 --> 1743.7600000000002  she saw a friendly cottage
1741.44 --> 1743.76  wow
1746.159 --> 1751.6000000000001  she knocked on the door
1748.399 --> 1753.6789999999999  but nobody was there
1751.6 --> 1756.6399999999999  she went inside
1753.679 --> 1759.1200000000001  the friendly cottage belonged to three
1756.64 --> 1759.1200000000001  bears
1760.96 --> 1766.3990000000001  goldilocks was very hungry
1763.679 --> 1768.48  she saw three bowls of porridge on the
1766.399 --> 1771.6  table
1768.48 --> 1773.76  first she tried a spoonful from daddy
1771.6 --> 1777.36  bear's big bowl
1773.76 --> 1780.96  this porridge is too hot next she tried
1777.36 --> 1784.1589999999999  from mama bear's medium bowl
1780.96 --> 1788.48  this porridge is also too hot finally
1784.159 --> 1792.0  she tried from baby bear's small bowl
1788.48 --> 1795.6  this porridge is just right
1792.0 --> 1798.559  and she ate the whole bowl
1795.6 --> 1803.1999999999998  now goldilocks was tired
1798.559 --> 1803.2  she saw three chairs kept in a room
1804.64 --> 1809.24  this chair is too big
1810.559 --> 1814.72  this chair is too big too
1816.32 --> 1820.72  this chair is just right
1821.039 --> 1826.8799999999999  but the chair broke
1823.36 --> 1829.6  goldilocks was very tired so she went
1826.88 --> 1829.6000000000001  upstairs
1834.559 --> 1838.96  she saw three beds in the room
1841.679 --> 1846.159  she sat on the first bed
1844.64 --> 1849.6000000000001  and thought
1846.159 --> 1853.279  this bed is too hard
1849.6 --> 1857.1999999999998  this bed is too soft
1853.279 --> 1857.2  this bed is just right
1857.679 --> 1862.8400000000001  soon the three bears came home
1864.32 --> 1870.48  who's been eating my parrot
1867.6 --> 1873.9189999999999  asked daddy bear
1870.48 --> 1874.799  who's been eating my porridge asked mama
1873.919 --> 1877.919  bear
1874.799 --> 1879.36  who's been eating my porridge and eaten
1877.919 --> 1882.72  it all up

1889.919 --> 1896.64  daddy bear howled
1893.36 --> 1898.24  who's been sitting on my chest wondered
1896.64 --> 1901.3600000000001  mama bear
1898.24 --> 1902.799  who's been sitting on my chair and it's
1901.36 --> 1906.9189999999999  broken
1902.799 --> 1906.9189999999999  cried baby bear
1913.039 --> 1918.559  they went up in the room and saw who's
1915.76 --> 1920.48  been sleeping on my bed
1918.559 --> 1923.519  said daddy bear
1920.48 --> 1926.88  who's been sleeping on my bed
1923.519 --> 1929.2  said mama bear who's been sleeping on my
1926.88 --> 1929.2  bed
1929.36 --> 1935.6  and she is still there
1931.84 --> 1938.399  screamed baby bear
1935.6 --> 1939.6789999999999  goldilocks woke up and saw the three
1938.399 --> 1942.799  bears
1939.679 --> 1945.679  she was so frightened that she jumped
1942.799 --> 1947.519  out of the bed and raced through the
1945.679 --> 1951.799  forest
1947.519 --> 1951.799  and she never came back
1963.039 --> 1967.279  oh
1964.08 --> 1970.32  goldilocks lost her way too
1967.279 --> 1970.32  just like us
1970.399 --> 1975.8799999999999  no tofu we have not lost our way
1976.799 --> 1981.48  see we're already at the camp

2000.96 --> 2005.76  these cookies become alive
2003.279 --> 2009.6  alive
2005.76 --> 2009.6  this reminds me of a story
2010.48 --> 2013.919  the gingerbread man
2014.559 --> 2019.84  long ago there lived an old couple
2022.799 --> 2031.32  one day the old woman cooked a
2025.919 --> 2031.3200000000002  gingerbread cookie in the shape of a man
2038.24 --> 2043.72  as soon as the gingerbread man was
2040.72 --> 2043.72  cooked
2050.56 --> 2059.879  he jumped out of the tin and ran out of
2053.839 --> 2059.879  the open window shouting don't eat me
2060.879 --> 2066.7999999999997  he ran away as fast as he could
2064.24 --> 2070.24  the old couple tried to chase the
2066.8 --> 2072.48  gingerbread man but he was too fast for
2070.24 --> 2072.4799999999996  them
2073.119 --> 2077.04  soon a hungry pig
2079.44 --> 2087.48  saw the gingerbread man and said
2082.32 --> 2087.48  stop i would like to eat you
2089.599 --> 2096.56  he too joined the chase
2093.359 --> 2097.839  the gingerbread man was too fast and
2096.56 --> 2101.04  said
2097.839 --> 2103.839  you can't catch me i am the gingerbread
2101.04 --> 2103.839  man
2113.599 --> 2119.2000000000003  a little further a hungry cow saw the
2116.8 --> 2123.28  gingerbread man and said
2119.2 --> 2123.2799999999997  stop i would like to eat you
2125.44 --> 2130.4  she too joined the chase

2130.4 --> 2133.839  i'm the gingerbread man
2138.72 --> 2143.16  next he met a horse
2144.32 --> 2148.32  the horse too joined the chase
2151.359 --> 2157.5989999999997  finally the gingerbread man came to a
2154.4 --> 2160.96  river and stopped as the river could
2157.599 --> 2164.2400000000002  make him soggy
2160.96 --> 2168.0  a clever fox came by
2164.24 --> 2168.0  and wanted to eat him up
2168.88 --> 2175.839  but he pretended to be nice and offered
2172.24 --> 2179.52  help to the gingerbread man he asked the
2175.839 --> 2183.92  gingerbread man to climb on his head so
2179.52 --> 2186.72  that he could take him across the river
2183.92 --> 2190.48  the gingerbread man was so scared of
2186.72 --> 2190.48  water that he agreed
2195.92 --> 2202.16  as soon as they reached the other side
2199.04 --> 2203.52  the fox tossed up the gingerbread man in
2202.16 --> 2206.8799999999997  the air
2203.52 --> 2211.599  he opened his mouth and ate him up
2206.88 --> 2211.599  that was the end of the gingerbread man
2212.64 --> 2218.48  i don't want my cookies alive and get
2215.28 --> 2218.48  eaten by a wolf

2271.44 --> 2273.76  sit
2275.599 --> 2283.0  i'll tell you an interesting story
2278.4 --> 2283.0  the fox and the sick lion
2286.56 --> 2292.4  once upon a time there lived a lion in
2289.68 --> 2292.3999999999996  the forest
2296.0 --> 2303.359  as the lion was growing old he was
2299.2 --> 2303.359  unable to hunt for his food
2304.56 --> 2311.32  he thought that without food he would
2307.599 --> 2311.32  die of starvation
2320.32 --> 2325.1600000000003  so the lion thought of a plan
2332.0 --> 2340.04  he decided to lie down in the cave and
2335.52 --> 2340.04  pretend that he is ill
2352.24 --> 2358.24  and whosoever will come to meet him will
2355.2 --> 2358.24  become his prey
2358.32 --> 2363.76  being the king of the jungle the lion
2360.96 --> 2369.4  announced he was sick and summoned the
2363.76 --> 2369.4  animals to come and hear his last will
2388.079 --> 2394.079  the lion put his sinful plan to practice
2391.119 --> 2396.48  and it started working
2394.079 --> 2400.32  poor animals didn't know about his
2396.48 --> 2405.2400000000002  wicked plan and fell into his trap
2400.32 --> 2405.2400000000002  many of his well-wishers got killed
2412.0 --> 2415.0  ah
2436.079 --> 2441.76  one day a fox came to visit the sick
2439.28 --> 2441.76  lion
2444.8 --> 2449.92  the fox was clever and discovered the
2447.599 --> 2449.92  trick
2450.0 --> 2457.359  he stood on the outside of the cave at a
2453.04 --> 2460.88  respectful distance and asked
2457.359 --> 2462.0789999999997  how are you sir i am not feeling well at
2460.88 --> 2466.319  all
2462.079 --> 2469.3590000000004  but why don't you come inside to meet me
2466.319 --> 2471.92  no thank you sir i noticed that there
2469.359 --> 2477.44  are many prince of feet entering your
2471.92 --> 2482.88  cave but i see no trace of any returning
2477.44 --> 2482.88  still if i come inside i would be a fool
2483.76 --> 2491.079  and the fox saved his life and informed
2487.04 --> 2491.079  other animals too
2495.599 --> 2503.2400000000002  so tofu the moral of the story is you

2627.92 --> 2632.079  noticed the smell of the delicious
2630.48 --> 2633.04  grapes
2632.079 --> 2635.44  wow
2633.04 --> 2637.52  there are so many grapes in this
2635.44 --> 2641.76  vineyard
2637.52 --> 2641.7599999999998  my mouth is watering
2643.52 --> 2649.319  the fox looked at the grape wine and
2646.319 --> 2649.319  drooled
2652.64 --> 2657.44  the fox jumped up towards the graves
2658.16 --> 2663.48  but the grapes were too high for him
2664.8 --> 2671.3590000000004  he tried and tried
2667.359 --> 2671.359  but the effort was futile
2671.599 --> 2678.319  he tried again
2673.359 --> 2678.319  and this time he was about to touch them
2679.68 --> 2683.04  but failed again
2683.76 --> 2686.5600000000004  oh
2684.56 --> 2689.52  i am so tired
2686.56 --> 2694.0  these grapes are too high
2689.52 --> 2697.52  i can't reach them at any cost
2694.0 --> 2700.72  he sat there and thought for a long time
2697.52 --> 2704.319  that how he can get those grapes
2700.72 --> 2707.9199999999996  he suddenly got up and said to himself
2704.319 --> 2712.48  those grapes are probably sour
2707.92 --> 2712.48  in fact i don't like grapes
2712.56 --> 2719.52  why should i try so hard for them
2716.88 --> 2724.2400000000002  the fox couldn't reach the grapes and
2719.52 --> 2724.24  hence escaped by making excuses
2727.2 --> 2735.2799999999997  but his tummy kept growling of hunger
2730.4 --> 2735.28  and he had to go without eating anything
2739.92 --> 2745.28  so tofu
2741.44 --> 2748.4  the fox had to go empty-handed because
2745.28 --> 2750.0  he just made an excuse
2748.4 --> 2753.04  always remember
2750.0 --> 2755.76  you won't achieve your goals if you give
2753.04 --> 2757.44  up by making excuses
2755.76 --> 2761.1600000000003  so let's go
2757.44 --> 2761.16  and try again
2782.0 --> 2785.0  oh
2793.359 --> 2798.319  what are you doing tofu
2795.44 --> 2800.079  i'm trying to water the plants but this
2798.319 --> 2803.7599999999998  hose is broken
2800.079 --> 2806.96  come let me tell you a short story
2803.76 --> 2806.96  the clever crow
2809.839 --> 2813.64  the clever crow
2834.56 --> 2838.16  one hot day
2836.16 --> 2841.2  a thirsty crow
2838.16 --> 2844.2  flew all over the fields looking for
2841.2 --> 2844.2  water
2848.16 --> 2851.16  oh
2871.04 --> 2874.04  um
2895.92 --> 2901.839  for a long time he could not find any
2899.04 --> 2901.839  water
2902.079 --> 2908.2400000000002  suddenly
2903.359 --> 2911.119  he saw a water jug below the tree
2908.24 --> 2914.7999999999997  he flew straight down to see if there
2911.119 --> 2917.119  was any water inside yes he could see
2914.8 --> 2920.079  some water inside the jug
2917.119 --> 2921.359  the crow tried to push his head into the
2920.079 --> 2924.0  jug
2921.359 --> 2927.04  sadly he found that the neck of the jug
2924.0 --> 2928.4  was too narrow
2927.04 --> 2933.2  what should i do
2928.4 --> 2936.1600000000003  i am really thirsty how do i drink water
2933.2 --> 2938.72  then he tried to push the jug to tilt
2936.16 --> 2942.0  for the water to flow out but the jug
2938.72 --> 2946.16  was too heavy he looked around and saw
2942.0 --> 2948.64  some pebbles he suddenly had a good idea
2946.16 --> 2951.92  he started picking up the pebbles one by
2948.64 --> 2954.72  one dropping each into the jug
2951.92 --> 2958.319  as more and more pebbles filled the jug
2954.72 --> 2960.8799999999997  the water level kept rising soon it was
2958.319 --> 2964.68  high enough for the crow to drink his
2960.88 --> 2964.6800000000003  plan had worked
2974.8 --> 2981.28  so like the clever crow was able to find
2978.4 --> 2984.0  a solution to the problem by thinking
2981.28 --> 2987.3590000000004  and working hard would you be able to
2984.0 --> 2987.359  find one to this too

3095.28 --> 3099.6800000000003  a nearby tree
3097.2 --> 3100.8799999999997  the ant was struggling for life in the
3099.68 --> 3103.44  water
3100.88 --> 3106.0  the dove felt very sad for the little
3103.44 --> 3109.2000000000003  ants
3106.0 --> 3112.24  oh no the little aunt is in trouble

3120.0 --> 3124.839  the tub quickly plucked off a leaf
3129.359 --> 3133.7599999999998  and dropped it into the water near the
3131.76 --> 3136.4  struggling ant
3133.76 --> 3139.44  the ant moved towards the leaf and
3136.4 --> 3143.52  climbed up there and the ant reached to
3139.44 --> 3146.2400000000002  the shore safely the thankful aunt said
3143.52 --> 3149.96  i will always be grateful to you for
3146.24 --> 3149.9599999999996  saving my life
3152.72 --> 3159.839  few weeks later the ant saw a bad hunter
3157.119 --> 3159.839  with a gun
3160.079 --> 3166.52  the hunter was targeting at the dove
3162.8 --> 3166.52  sitting on the tree
3170.8 --> 3176.48  guessing what he was about to do the ant
3173.839 --> 3181.839  quickly bit him on the hill
3176.48 --> 3181.839  ouch you pathetic ant what have you done
3188.96 --> 3196.76  the aunt walked away happily as she was
3191.92 --> 3196.76  able to help the dove in return
3211.839 --> 3218.7999999999997  so tofu just the way dove's good deed

3254.079 --> 3261.599  it happen to me let me tell you a story
3257.76 --> 3261.599  the fox and the stork
3261.68 --> 3270.319  once a fox and a stork were friends
3265.44 --> 3270.319  and the fox invited the stork for dinner
3273.359 --> 3278.72  dear friend i wish to invite you for a
3276.319 --> 3281.599  meal at my home
3278.72 --> 3284.8799999999997  i will cook a delicious soup for you
3281.599 --> 3284.88  i would love to come
3290.96 --> 3295.04  the fox made a delicious soup as
3293.76 --> 3298.3190000000004  promised
3295.04 --> 3301.359  the fox was very clever and played a
3298.319 --> 3301.359  cruel trick
3302.0 --> 3307.599  when the stark visited his home that
3304.559 --> 3310.6400000000003  evening she was given a shallow dish
3307.599 --> 3310.6400000000003  filled with soup
3314.4 --> 3320.88  thus the fox could easily lap up but the
3317.68 --> 3325.839  stark could only wet the end of her bill
3320.88 --> 3325.839  in it i have made this delicious soup
3326.72 --> 3331.319  myself enjoy your meal
3334.16 --> 3339.92  stork did not say anything and pretended
3337.68 --> 3342.72  to enjoy the meal
3339.92 --> 3347.319  at the end of the evening however the
3342.72 --> 3347.319  stark went home hungry
3348.319 --> 3356.319  one week later the stork invited the fox
3352.48 --> 3356.319  for lunch at her house
3359.44 --> 3366.48  dear fox why don't you come to my house
3362.319 --> 3368.16  for lunch i'm cooking fish for the meal
3366.48 --> 3370.4  said the stark
3368.16 --> 3372.96  thank you jeer stock
3370.4 --> 3376.44  i would be happy to come
3372.96 --> 3376.44  said the fox
3380.0 --> 3385.0  the stock made delicious fish
3392.24 --> 3398.72  when the fox arrived the stalks served
3395.2 --> 3398.72  the fish in a pitcher
3401.28 --> 3406.799  the fox stared hungrily at the food but
3404.4 --> 3409.04  he could not taste it
3406.799 --> 3412.16  he had a thick snout
3409.04 --> 3415.2799999999997  and couldn't eat from the pitcher
3412.16 --> 3418.96  so all he could manage to do was to lick
3415.28 --> 3422.079  the outside of the pitcher
3418.96 --> 3425.28  did you enjoy the lunch my friend i made
3422.079 --> 3428.799  it especially for you ask the stock with
3425.28 --> 3431.44  a nasty smile the fox remembered his
3428.799 --> 3432.4  cruel trick on the stark and had to
3431.44 --> 3435.44  confess
3432.4 --> 3438.559  that the clever stark made him learn a
3435.44 --> 3441.599  lesson the stark enjoyed the meal while
3438.559 --> 3444.92  the fox looked on sheepishly and went
3441.599 --> 3444.92  home hungry
3452.72 --> 3460.319  so tofu as the fox did bad to the stark
3456.48 --> 3463.2  the stark did back to him too because
3460.319 --> 3466.7599999999998  one bad turn deserves another
3463.2 --> 3466.7599999999998  now i understand
3488.559 --> 3494.4  what are you trying to do tofu i am
3491.2 --> 3497.2799999999997  trying to pluck mangoes from this tree
3494.4 --> 3500.2400000000002  but the effort is going useless that's
3497.28 --> 3502.48  because the mangoes are too far away and
3500.24 --> 3505.68  the stones are too heavy
3502.48 --> 3508.319  then what should i do tia i really want
3505.68 --> 3511.52  those mangoes
3508.319 --> 3515.5589999999997  let me tell you a story
3511.52 --> 3515.559  the three little pigs
3517.119 --> 3522.88  once upon a time
3519.599 --> 3522.88  there was a mama pig
3524.319 --> 3528.68  and three little pigs
3538.48 --> 3542.96  one day
3539.68 --> 3546.64  mama pig said to them you are old enough
3542.96 --> 3546.64  to build your own houses
3552.48 --> 3557.319  the first pig built a house of straw
3560.0 --> 3564.48  he said
3561.52 --> 3567.799  now the wolf can't come and catch me and
3564.48 --> 3567.799  eat me
3572.72 --> 3576.64  the second pig built his house with
3575.52 --> 3579.599  sticks
3576.64 --> 3582.799  stronger than the first pig's house
3579.599 --> 3587.079  he said now the wolf can't come and
3582.799 --> 3587.079  catch me and eat me
3588.559 --> 3594.1600000000003  the third pig built his house with
3591.04 --> 3596.319  bricks stronger than the second pig's
3594.16 --> 3599.04  house he said
3596.319 --> 3601.839  now the wolves can't come and catch me
3599.04 --> 3601.839  and eat me
3602.319 --> 3609.119  next day
3603.52 --> 3609.119  the wolf came to the house made of straw
3609.44 --> 3615.68  the wolf knocked at the door and said
3612.16 --> 3617.839  little big little pig let me come in i
3615.68 --> 3618.72  will not let you come in said the little
3617.839 --> 3621.44  pig
3618.72 --> 3624.319  then i will huff and puff and blow your
3621.44 --> 3626.2400000000002  house away said the wolf
3624.319 --> 3629.799  so he huffed
3626.24 --> 3629.799  and puffed
3630.64 --> 3634.799  the house of straw fell down
3635.359 --> 3644.5589999999997  and the wolf ate up the first little pig
3640.559 --> 3647.2000000000003  next day the wolf came to the house made
3644.559 --> 3650.799  of sticks he knocked at the door and
3647.2 --> 3653.2799999999997  said little pig little pig let me come
3650.799 --> 3656.96  in i will not let you come and set the
3653.28 --> 3659.92  little pig then i will huff and puff and
3656.96 --> 3661.599  blow your house away said the wolf
3659.92 --> 3665.599  so he huffed
3661.599 --> 3669.2000000000003  and puffed and blew the house away
3665.599 --> 3671.52  the house of sticks fell down
3669.2 --> 3675.4399999999996  and the wolf ate up
3671.52 --> 3675.44  the second little pig
3677.28 --> 3679.92  next day
3680.079 --> 3685.8390000000004  the wolf came
3681.76 --> 3685.8390000000004  to the house made of bricks
3688.48 --> 3694.96  little big little pig let me come in
3692.64 --> 3698.319  i will not let you come in said the
3694.96 --> 3700.319  little pig then i will huff and puff and
3698.319 --> 3702.4  blow your house away
3700.319 --> 3705.92  said the wolf
3702.4 --> 3707.28  the big bad wolf tried to huff
3705.92 --> 3711.96  and puff
3707.28 --> 3711.96  and blow the house down
3714.079 --> 3717.039  but he couldn't
3717.44 --> 3725.48  he kept trying for ours but the house
3721.359 --> 3725.48  was very strong
3727.52 --> 3733.599  he tried to enter through the chimney
3730.72 --> 3736.64  but the clever third little pig
3733.599 --> 3739.92  boiled a big pot of water and kept it
3736.64 --> 3742.64  below the chimney the wolf fell into it
3739.92 --> 3742.64  and died
3744.24 --> 3749.839  so the way the third wise pig managed to
3747.599 --> 3751.44  escape from the wolf without using
3749.839 --> 3754.24  weapons but
3751.44 --> 3757.64  through his wisdom would you be able to
3754.24 --> 3757.64  do the same
3784.799 --> 3790.4  what happened tofu
3786.799 --> 3793.359  tia today in school our teacher asked us
3790.4 --> 3797.28  to write something about the wolf
3793.359 --> 3799.92  so why don't you write about it but tia
3797.28 --> 3801.44  i don't know anything about how a wolf
3799.92 --> 3804.4  behaves
3801.44 --> 3806.96  come let me tell you a story and then
3804.4 --> 3809.2000000000003  you would be able to figure out how it
3806.96 --> 3812.96  behaves
3809.2 --> 3812.96  the wolf and the crane
3818.16 --> 3825.3999999999996  one day a hungry wolf was eating his
3822.4 --> 3825.4  prey
3829.359 --> 3836.2  so rapidly
3830.96 --> 3836.2  that a bone got stuck in his throat
3840.72 --> 3846.3999999999996  he ran around the forest howling in pain
3847.92 --> 3853.839  please help me
3849.839 --> 3853.839  i will reward handsomely
3855.44 --> 3860.839  anyone who removes the bone from my
3857.839 --> 3860.839  throat
3877.359 --> 3882.72  a passing crane
3879.119 --> 3882.7200000000003  to pity on the wolf
3886.96 --> 3891.44  even though the task was dangerous
3893.52 --> 3898.48  the lure of the prophet motivated him to

4031.599 --> 4037.92  but i was hungry tia
4035.039 --> 4042.3190000000004  you need to listen to this story
4037.92 --> 4042.319  the goose that laid golden eggs
4042.4 --> 4045.599  once upon a time
4044.24 --> 4051.0389999999998  in a village
4045.599 --> 4051.039  there lived a poor farmer with his wife
4052.24 --> 4058.64  they had nothing but a little farm where
4055.44 --> 4061.599  they grew vegetables that they could eat
4058.64 --> 4062.4  however he managed to save a little
4061.599 --> 4064.96  money
4062.4 --> 4066.2400000000002  each time he sold vegetables from his
4064.96 --> 4069.599  farm
4066.24 --> 4071.7599999999998  eventually he saved up enough money to
4069.599 --> 4074.319  buy a goose
4071.76 --> 4076.48  he took it home and made a nest for it
4074.319 --> 4079.119  to lay eggs
4076.48 --> 4081.119  the goose will produce eggs which he
4079.119 --> 4083.6800000000003  could use for selling
4081.119 --> 4085.119  eating and making bread thought the
4083.68 --> 4087.839  farmer
4085.119 --> 4090.799  the next morning when he went to gather
4087.839 --> 4093.92  some eggs for his breakfast he lifted
4090.799 --> 4096.319  the goose and to his surprise the goose
4093.92 --> 4099.52  had laid a golden egg
4096.319 --> 4104.120000000001  the next morning he found another egg
4099.52 --> 4104.120000000001  and the next and the next
4105.52 --> 4113.56  slowly and steadily the farmer and his
4108.319 --> 4113.56  wife were becoming richer and richer
4120.799 --> 4126.159  just think if we could have all the
4123.279 --> 4130.6  golden eggs that are inside the goose we
4126.159 --> 4130.599999999999  could be richer much faster
4135.679 --> 4143.159  you're right we wouldn't have to wait
4138.159 --> 4143.159  for the goose to lay her egg every day
4158.0 --> 4161.0  hey
4162.319 --> 4168.080000000001  so the couple killed the goose and cut
4165.279 --> 4168.080000000001  her open
4172.88 --> 4178.96  only to find that she was just like
4175.839 --> 4178.96  every other goose
4180.56 --> 4184.799  she had no golden eggs inside of her at
4183.759 --> 4188.799  all
4184.799 --> 4189.92  and they had no more golden eggs
4188.799 --> 4192.719  alas
4189.92 --> 4195.679  now the farmer and his wife had lost the
4192.719 --> 4199.64  goose and they would never get any
4195.679 --> 4199.64  golden eggs again
4202.32 --> 4208.159  so tofu just like the couple suffered
4205.76 --> 4211.280000000001  because they were greedy you should be
4208.159 --> 4215.12  careful too because too much greed
4211.28 --> 4218.719  always leads to great loss oh got it tia
4215.12 --> 4218.719  i'll be careful next time
