23.64 --> 28.279  held at the exact same time and it's the
26.279 --> 30.759  first time in history the candidates is
28.279 --> 33.0  in North America inter Tonto Canada
30.759 --> 34.96  where I was just for 72 hours I'm going
33.0 --> 36.68  to be posting a bunch of interviews that
34.96 --> 38.76  I did with players I already posted one
36.68 --> 41.16  that I did with hikaro and Fabiano we
38.76 --> 42.8  have Yan pishi coming as well I did an
41.16 --> 45.199999999999996  interview with vishi Anan that's super
42.8 --> 47.199  special I recorded a bunch of IRL
45.2 --> 49.28  content with chess fans and now I'm back
47.199 --> 50.519999999999996  here and I'm making this recap for you
49.28 --> 52.199  and for the first four days of the
50.52 --> 55.719  candidates we're doing a candidate sale
52.199 --> 58.559  on Chesley and uh all my courses are 33%
55.719 --> 59.760000000000005  off so get ready to follow uh this
58.559 --> 64.67999999999999  tournament throughout the month of April
59.76 --> 68.72  on channel here we go in round number
64.68 --> 71.24000000000001  one we have Fabiano Carana versus hikara
68.72 --> 74.28  Nakamura and uh I will take you through
71.24 --> 75.759  every single game of the day let me know
74.28 --> 77.56  if you like this format because it's
75.759 --> 79.799  obviously eight games I will be going
77.56 --> 80.96000000000001  quickly or if you want me to exclude
79.799 --> 84.119  certain things if they're a little bit
80.96 --> 87.55999999999999  boring do let me know Fabiano Carana
84.119 --> 88.6  opens with the move E4 and if you're
87.56 --> 90.0  wondering who's playing in the
88.6 --> 91.72  candidates you will figure it out by by
90.0 --> 93.799  the end of the recap but I will give you
91.72 --> 95.84  an update every single day uh last
93.799 --> 97.96000000000001  candidates this was the exact matchup in
95.84 --> 99.72  the first round Fabiano Carana versus
97.96 --> 101.79899999999999  Hikaru they make people from the same
99.72 --> 103.79899999999999  country play each other earlier so that
101.799 --> 105.88000000000001  there's no collusion not that they're
103.799 --> 109.04  accusing anybody but it's just what they
105.88 --> 111.28  do and Hikaru plays the Sicilian Defense
109.04 --> 113.92  the most combative confrontational way
111.28 --> 115.52  to play against E4 the second way being
113.92 --> 118.32000000000001  the Scandinavian but you will never see
115.52 --> 122.119  it in the candidates cuz it's poopy butt
118.32 --> 123.83999999999999  C5 and we have an open Sicilian and if
122.119 --> 125.68  you're going to play like this you got
123.84 --> 127.479  two choices in yeah three choices in
125.68 --> 130.44  this position you play the nidorf the
127.479 --> 132.28  classical you have the dragon and then
130.44 --> 137.44  you have the classical Sicilian with
132.28 --> 141.4  Knight C6 iaru plays
137.44 --> 144.239  E5 this is an insane move now for most
141.4 --> 145.64000000000001  of you watching you don't get it and
144.239 --> 147.0  that's fine and I'm not insulting you
145.64 --> 149.44  I'm just saying there's a clear
147.0 --> 151.28  disconnect between top level chests uh
149.44 --> 153.92  and and standard people at home like
151.28 --> 156.76  yourself watching the reason why black
153.92 --> 158.599  goes here is to prevent any piece from
156.76 --> 160.159  going to B5 and this opening is called
158.599 --> 162.51899999999998  the nidorf and it survived the test of
160.159 --> 165.67999999999998  time you know who would have literally
162.519 --> 168.12  1,000 lines memorized against the nidorf
165.68 --> 170.92000000000002  Fabiano Hikaru plays The Accelerated
168.12 --> 173.08  Knight ORF allowing Bishop B5 check and
170.92 --> 175.44  traditionally this position has been
173.08 --> 177.15900000000002  considered quite bad for black like
175.44 --> 179.44  black has to fight back and white is
177.159 --> 180.79999999999998  very active now what's fascinating is
179.44 --> 182.64  that this position was reached by
180.8 --> 184.68  Fabiano in a title Tuesday game this is
182.64 --> 186.72  how online chess has completely
184.68 --> 188.76000000000002  transformed classical chess and
186.72 --> 190.72  traditional over theboard play FBI in
188.76 --> 193.12  that game took the Knight rotated
190.72 --> 196.0  backwards and dominated that square but
193.12 --> 198.36  in this game he plays a the retreating
196.0 --> 200.76  move Bishop A4 which is not as popular
198.36 --> 202.31900000000002  gets his Bishop kicked out but this
200.76 --> 203.51899999999998  square is going to be up for grabs and
202.319 --> 205.11999999999998  that is the square that Fab is going to
203.519 --> 206.56  try to utilize now you're going to
205.12 --> 208.59900000000002  notice the engine gives this slightly
206.56 --> 210.799  better for white cuz it is cuz it's a
208.599 --> 212.79899999999998  dubious way of playing this Ian but
210.799 --> 214.59900000000002  Hikaru wants to take Fabby out of his
212.799 --> 217.439  comfort zone and the players play a
214.599 --> 219.599  bunch of theory Bishop F6 Bishop F6 as
217.439 --> 221.0  you see everything in Fabiano's position
219.599 --> 223.39999999999998  is around the light squares in the
221.0 --> 226.48  center we have opposite colored Bishops
223.4 --> 228.20000000000002  and he castles but hearu emerges from
226.48 --> 230.439  the opening with a
228.2 --> 233.2  34 Minute time Advantage technically
230.439 --> 236.239  it's like 33 and 5 Seconds but that's a
233.2 --> 238.23899999999998  big deal that is a very very very big
236.239 --> 240.159  deal this is a completely different
238.239 --> 241.68  story from Madrid 2022 some of you
240.159 --> 243.879  weren't even born in
241.68 --> 245.4  2022 that year they played in the first
243.879 --> 247.159  round of the candidates hearo lost this
245.4 --> 251.0  time he clearly has the upper hand and
247.159 --> 252.84  he sacrifices a pawn he gives up a pawn
251.0 --> 254.879  because it really can't be taken because
252.84 --> 256.959  of all this pressure to get the bishop
254.879 --> 259.359  and to simplify the game into an
256.959 --> 262.8  opposite colored Bishop position Bobby
259.359 --> 265.56  does this rookie W Hikaru gives up this
262.8 --> 267.12  takes back on B2 and plays Bishop six
265.56 --> 268.52  Hikaru is still up 35 minutes on the
267.12 --> 270.039  clock he's playing quickly he's playing
268.52 --> 271.88  confidently he's got the opposite
270.039 --> 274.08  colored Bishops and he knows that in the
271.88 --> 275.44  long run this is probably going to be
274.08 --> 276.68  good enough to hold and a draw against
275.44 --> 278.44  Fabiano with the black pieces in the
276.68 --> 280.6  first round of the candidates is a very
278.44 --> 282.32  good way to go all right eight eight and
280.6 --> 285.8  a half is the magic number to win the
282.32 --> 288.52  candidates Queen D5 but Fabby not to be
285.8 --> 293.0  outdone gets in with the queen Hikaru
288.52 --> 294.88  now spends 35 minutes on a move 35
293.0 --> 296.0  minutes probably about five of those
294.88 --> 297.96  minutes were spent thinking about the
296.0 --> 299.919  move and 30 were spent thinking about
297.96 --> 300.919  daffodils or I don't know whatever chess
299.919 --> 302.96  players think about when they're playing
300.919 --> 306.24  chess it it's probably probably not
302.96 --> 307.96  chess so the thing is Black's position
306.24 --> 309.84000000000003  is on the verge of complete collapse
307.96 --> 311.56  like optically Black's position looks
309.84 --> 313.96  beyond garbage I mean I'm I'm not trying
311.56 --> 316.08  to insult what hikaro is doing hikaro
313.96 --> 318.12  took a very deliberate thing in this
316.08 --> 320.19899999999996  game he he he went for the position that
318.12 --> 322.52  looked optically bad and he's trying to
320.199 --> 324.56  solve his problems all right but guess
322.52 --> 327.28  what the problems have not been solved
324.56 --> 329.96  Hikaru finds a rook sacrifice here by
327.28 --> 332.88  the way a defensive one you can't can't
329.96 --> 335.479  take this because after Queen H4 you're
332.88 --> 337.68  under a massive attack you go King F1 I
335.479 --> 340.919  have Rook E8 and despite being up a full
337.68 --> 343.52  Rook that's Checkmate so like you got to
340.919 --> 345.68  be really careful right G3 stops the
343.52 --> 347.039  mate Queen H3 Falls right back into mate
345.68 --> 348.36  hearo plays Rook F2 which is a
347.039 --> 350.88  ridiculous move I mean getting hit with
348.36 --> 353.12  Rook F2 is is brutal but Fab's still
350.88 --> 354.759  better and not only is fabbi better at
353.12 --> 357.56  this point the engine gave Fabiano a
354.759 --> 359.88  winning Advantage deep engine analysis
357.56 --> 363.919  here shows that it's not 6 as as this
359.88 --> 367.479  engine is saying but it's like 1.3 but
363.919 --> 368.79999999999995  Bobby has 12 minutes to make 13 moves
367.479 --> 370.199  because that is the time control of the
368.8 --> 372.40000000000003  candidates and the candidates they play
370.199 --> 374.8  five six hour games on the 40th move of
372.4 --> 376.23999999999995  the game they get an extra time to play
374.8 --> 379.08  the rest of the game and there's no
376.24 --> 381.0  bonus time there's no bonus time for the
379.08 --> 383.31899999999996  first 40 moves so Fabi could lose on
381.0 --> 385.12  time if he starts thinking here a lot
383.319 --> 387.199  right and you'll notice hikaro played
385.12 --> 388.319  this move very quickly and Fabby said
387.199 --> 389.759  that actually kind of got him a little
388.319 --> 391.759  spooked because he thought he was better
389.759 --> 393.88  he's up a pawn he could start pushing
391.759 --> 395.599  but if he starts pushing this Pawn Karu
393.88 --> 398.96  is's going to get his Rooks right
395.599 --> 400.96  White's King a little bit so he goes
398.96 --> 404.4  here and all the advantage is
400.96 --> 406.23999999999995  gone he does this they start trading and
404.4 --> 407.75899999999996  despite being a pawn up fobby can't move
406.24 --> 410.319  these two pawns he tries I mean he
407.759 --> 411.91900000000004  definitely starts moving them but Hikaru
410.319 --> 414.91900000000004  is so active here look at this move Rook
411.919 --> 417.56  A8 by the way what e he just hung The
414.919 --> 419.599  Rook no because then Queen takes then
417.56 --> 424.08  Queen E2 check and you win The Rook back
419.599 --> 426.039  and Hikaru this game defended stubbornly
424.08 --> 427.96  won the pawn back and this is just going
426.039 --> 430.52  to be a draw fabbi makes it to the time
427.96 --> 431.79999999999995  control and uh in this position the
430.52 --> 433.84  players agree to a draw you'll notice
431.8 --> 435.599  that they gained some time on the 40th
433.84 --> 437.87899999999996  move they gained 30 minutes this one
435.599 --> 440.4  ends in a draw a very big improvement
437.879 --> 442.84000000000003  from the candidates of 2022 by hikaro a
440.4 --> 444.79999999999995  combative draw with black I have no idea
442.84 --> 446.79999999999995  why he decided to make it exquisitly
444.8 --> 448.52000000000004  exciting for the fans but a very good
446.8 --> 452.12  start both of these guys now have half a
448.52 --> 455.24  point now uh Nar abasov the underdog
452.12 --> 456.72  2632 from aeran and not only that uh I
455.24 --> 458.68  did an interview with him he's a torn
456.72 --> 460.199  ACL you're going to see photos of the
458.68 --> 462.56  tournament he's literally wearing a
460.199 --> 465.36  brace he had surgery like a few months
462.56 --> 466.72  ago versus yan pishi yan pishi is a
465.36 --> 468.36  two-time winner of the candidates back
466.72 --> 469.91900000000004  toback he's played in two candidates and
468.36 --> 472.199  he's won two candidates and I have a
469.919 --> 473.28  statistics degree which makes me think
472.199 --> 474.8  that he's going to play in his third
473.28 --> 477.599  candidates and he might win it because
474.8 --> 479.879  that's how probabilities work but this
477.599 --> 482.56  game starts out with a queen Gambit
479.879 --> 484.0  declined it's an exchange variation uh
482.56 --> 485.199  excuse me it is not an exchange
484.0 --> 486.68  variation is what I meant to say
485.199 --> 490.0  exchange variation would be if white
486.68 --> 492.36  takes very solid but here's the thing if
490.0 --> 495.0  white wants to play a Queen's Gambit and
492.36 --> 497.40000000000003  do nothing like if white plays a Queen's
495.0 --> 500.319  Gambit declined right plays into it like
497.4 --> 501.79999999999995  this and just wants to do absolutely
500.319 --> 505.24  nothing in this
501.8 --> 508.28000000000003  game black has to take massive risk and
505.24 --> 510.44  it's not possible to win um and uh what
508.28 --> 513.4789999999999  ends up happening in this game is n
510.44 --> 515.519  plays Bishop takes Knight and D5 and you
513.479 --> 517.08  will notice Yan with the black pieces is
515.519 --> 518.839  up 20 minutes because he played a very
517.08 --> 521.6800000000001  solid line like it's round one of the
518.839 --> 524.12  candidates some some players like Hikaru
521.68 --> 527.16  get really exotic with it and some guys
524.12 --> 530.2  literally trade every single piece and
527.16 --> 531.68  go home in an hour and this was the
530.2 --> 533.6400000000001  position after 24
531.68 --> 536.0799999999999  moves who's to
533.64 --> 538.12  blame I don't know Unstoppable Force
536.08 --> 539.519  meets a movable object I mean Yan just
538.12 --> 541.279  wanted to get the candidates underway
539.519 --> 542.72  and I think kind of so did NJ you know a
541.279 --> 544.16  little bit of an Underdog Story you you
542.72 --> 546.0400000000001  don't want to like burn all the bridges
544.16 --> 547.12  in the first game and it's a queen's
546.04 --> 549.1999999999999  gamb declin like what are you going to
547.12 --> 550.76  do right and you'll notice n was kind of
549.2 --> 553.36  thinking early like he spent five
550.76 --> 556.3199999999999  minutes then he spent uh another like he
553.36 --> 558.48  spent 18 minutes on this move right like
556.32 --> 559.9200000000001  Yan was just sort of doing his thing and
558.48 --> 563.64  yeah I mean it's sort of up to White
559.92 --> 566.0  like if white wants to do this the
563.64 --> 567.279  players agree to a draw after 34 moves
566.0 --> 570.079  right they Shuffle around they make a
567.279 --> 573.079  draw okay so NJ and nepo have the same
570.079 --> 574.399  score as Fabiano and Hikaru now we're
573.079 --> 576.519  going to pop on over to the women's
574.399 --> 579.48  candidates Alexandra gachina versus
576.519 --> 582.32  Katarina uh lagno this is a uh another
579.48 --> 584.88  Sicilian Defense this one Bishop B5 this
582.32 --> 587.72  is known as the Rosal liimo and here
584.88 --> 590.04  lagno plays a a huge sideline like the
587.72 --> 593.1600000000001  whole reason you go here is cu you want
590.04 --> 594.48  to not allow this to be a check which is
593.16 --> 596.16  why it's super weird that in this
594.48 --> 597.9590000000001  position you then play D6 anyway but it
596.16 --> 600.36  but it's very uncompromising I mean it's
597.959 --> 602.92  basically uh it's just the choice and
600.36 --> 604.0  now you play Bishop D7 so that if Bishop
602.92 --> 606.3199999999999  takes Knight you take back with the
604.0 --> 608.6  bishop instead of the pawn and now you
606.32 --> 610.0790000000001  waited too long so white goes Bishop one
608.6 --> 611.16  I'm telling you you're going to watch
610.079 --> 613.88  this as a beginner you're going to be
611.16 --> 616.279  very confused but the entire point is I
613.88 --> 618.6  brought this out here to make you commit
616.279 --> 620.519  to setting up like that now I slide The
618.6 --> 622.24  Rook put the bishop there and now I'm
620.519 --> 623.64  going to put two Pawns in the center but
622.24 --> 625.32  black is going to stop that but in
623.64 --> 627.079  stopping that black is going to allow me
625.32 --> 629.44  access to these squares which is why I
627.079 --> 631.16  do all of this like chess is very
629.44 --> 632.8000000000001  complicated and very tough to understand
631.16 --> 634.56  at a high level and I just told you
632.8 --> 637.3199999999999  white wants to play D4 right white wants
634.56 --> 639.88  to get a big Center well white plays D3
637.32 --> 641.36  so gacha down 20 minutes on the clock in
639.88 --> 642.4399999999999  the opening but she is securing the
641.36 --> 645.839  control of the light squares in the
642.44 --> 647.6800000000001  center and uh if black is successful at
645.839 --> 649.36  any point in lashing out in the position
647.68 --> 651.56  black is going to have a great time
649.36 --> 653.44  which is why gachina is trying to trade
651.56 --> 655.399  off lago's knight from controlling the
653.44 --> 657.639  center she is able to do that what a
655.399 --> 660.279  move by the way I mean Knight F5 is an
657.639 --> 662.32  incredible idea and it's kind of a
660.279 --> 664.88  trojan horse because if you take I'm
662.32 --> 667.9200000000001  going to get a big attack which is why
664.88 --> 670.0  she didn't take so the Knight went back
667.92 --> 673.12  the Knight was on E3 but it rotated this
670.0 --> 675.12  way right now G5 now G going to go for
673.12 --> 677.92  it H5 locking the whole thing down but
675.12 --> 680.2  yeah g oh my goodness that is a crazy
677.92 --> 681.68  maneuvering sequence Queen E6 Queen D1
680.2 --> 684.8000000000001  and still white is looking to kind of
681.68 --> 686.88  poke and prod but black breaks out uh
684.8 --> 688.68  both players at around 15 minutes and
686.88 --> 690.16  suddenly it and and sometimes it just so
688.68 --> 693.3199999999999  happens in ch is just nothing you can do
690.16 --> 694.8  Rook f8 Rook E2 and uh the players here
693.32 --> 696.0790000000001  literally just Shuffle the pieces and
694.8 --> 697.7199999999999  that is the way they make the draw
696.079 --> 699.0  three- time repetition in chess when you
697.72 --> 700.639  Shuffle three times or the position
699.0 --> 702.44  repeats three times could the game have
700.639 --> 705.04  kept going from here like night night
702.44 --> 707.2790000000001  here yeah lagno could have played Queen
705.04 --> 708.4399999999999  G5 or queen H4 if this is round seven of
707.279 --> 709.76  the candidates like if this is round
708.44 --> 712.519  eight if this is later in the event the
709.76 --> 714.8389999999999  players kind of know their form uh black
712.519 --> 716.519  will probably keep the game going that's
714.839 --> 717.639  just the truth but it's round one I
716.519 --> 720.079  think a lot of the players are trying to
717.639 --> 721.519  find their footing you know you wake up
720.079 --> 723.279  every day at the candidates and don't
721.519 --> 725.16  want to get zero points it's just sort
723.279 --> 727.0  of the reality so I'm kind of getting
725.16 --> 729.1999999999999  the quick draws out of the way gukesh
727.0 --> 732.199  versus vidit this a big one all India
729.2 --> 734.32  match up in the first game uh this one a
732.199 --> 736.88  tarash this is known as the tarash
734.32 --> 739.6  defense a very aggressive choice and you
736.88 --> 741.959  notice that gukesh does not take the
739.6 --> 743.9590000000001  Tash is a very forcing line white has
741.959 --> 745.7199999999999  the option to clear the entire Center
743.959 --> 748.5189999999999  black would go here attacking the the
745.72 --> 751.12  the the Knight here and black has like
748.519 --> 753.32  some crazy lines like B5 I mean you know
751.12 --> 755.04  if if white goes here black can take and
753.32 --> 756.36  then play like Queen A5 check it's not
755.04 --> 759.12  the best way but I'm just saying that's
756.36 --> 762.6  sort of like the little idea uh in a
759.12 --> 765.16  nutshell but gukesh plays a very solid
762.6 --> 767.1990000000001  and sober approach and the position is
765.16 --> 770.36  completely symmetrical after five
767.199 --> 772.519  moves completely symmetrical and this is
770.36 --> 774.32  not good you can't get an advantage here
772.519 --> 776.92  with white cuz black is just going to
774.32 --> 779.839  copy you the whole time so gkes does
776.92 --> 786.4799999999999  this and then he does Rook A2
779.839 --> 789.839  Rook D2 what the what yeah Rook A2 Rook
786.48 --> 792.16  D2 this game explodes GES says you know
789.839 --> 794.519  what I'mma put the cannon on the D file
792.16 --> 798.079  I'm going to open up the G file and vid
794.519 --> 801.399  says oh yeah go ahead take my Center
798.079 --> 803.56  Pawn not only does vidit Castle onto the
801.399 --> 805.24  G file he also gives up a pawn
803.56 --> 807.3599999999999  completely in the center now it's not
805.24 --> 809.399  exactly a free Pawn because this is not
807.36 --> 811.639  vid's idea right this is losing for
809.399 --> 814.079  black that's not vid's idea the idea is
811.639 --> 816.199  that after cd5 uh black can play Bishop
814.079 --> 818.079  E5 Target the Knight and then get this
816.199 --> 820.92  also black can apparently go here which
818.079 --> 825.079  is completely deranged losing a pawn for
820.92 --> 827.04  nothing but black is better and uh yeah
825.079 --> 829.519  I mean somehow White's position is bad
827.04 --> 833.56  Bishop B2 from gkes and that's what
829.519 --> 835.639  vidit does so vidit finds this idea and
833.56 --> 837.8389999999999  vid understands that despite being down
835.639 --> 839.0790000000001  a PA he has a lot of activi a file is
837.839 --> 840.8800000000001  going to activate the bishop is
839.079 --> 842.56  pressuring this and somehow white just
840.88 --> 843.72  doesn't have a lot of Harmony just
842.56 --> 846.079  doesn't have a lot of Harmony what is he
843.72 --> 847.639  going to do right white can play like
846.079 --> 849.079  like how does white defend this if white
847.639 --> 851.0790000000001  comes over here right we're going to get
849.079 --> 853.959  this bishop D like what is White's plan
851.079 --> 855.199  like if white does this black will just
853.959 --> 858.0  focus on that side of the board like
855.199 --> 859.24  there's no attack which is why just like
858.0 --> 861.32  in a couple of these other games that
859.24 --> 863.5600000000001  you are seeing there is a bailout
861.32 --> 867.1600000000001  process I mean this looks really really
863.56 --> 869.88  really dangerous Queen C2 and vidid is
867.16 --> 872.4399999999999  better here I mean he has he the world
869.88 --> 874.759  is kind of his oyster in this position
872.44 --> 877.24  uh I know the engine says this but
874.759 --> 878.639  practically speaking you can't possibly
877.24 --> 879.8  tell me that this does not look very
878.639 --> 882.24  nice for
879.8 --> 883.4399999999999  black but vidit spends a while here and
882.24 --> 887.32  goes
883.44 --> 890.6  here so vidit spent 40 minutes on this
887.32 --> 893.8000000000001  move gcash fell asleep at the board no
890.6 --> 897.8000000000001  I'm just kidding Bishop G4 is a is a
893.8 --> 900.8389999999999  nice idea uh and it's very aggressive
897.8 --> 903.639  but and just so you understand the idea
900.839 --> 906.639  is Pawn takes Rook
903.639 --> 908.5600000000001  C8 attacking the queen and now when the
906.639 --> 910.0  queen step somewhere The Rook comes in
908.56 --> 911.4799999999999  and white can't defend himself white has
910.0 --> 913.0  three pieces on their home scores on the
911.48 --> 914.6800000000001  home scare right so it doesn't work so
913.0 --> 918.16  Bishop G4 is actually brilliant idea
914.68 --> 920.6389999999999  only one problem this and now that's
918.16 --> 923.199  hanging and that is still hanging Queen
920.639 --> 926.279  A3 white can take if white wants to go
923.199 --> 928.56  on a roller coaster ride but gukesh says
926.279 --> 930.8389999999999  it's the first round of the candidates
928.56 --> 932.7589999999999  so we've reached a position where I can
930.839 --> 935.12  take massive risk but I won't so we're
932.759 --> 937.759  seeing a lot of games sort of Peter out
935.12 --> 939.24  right seeing a lot of games like bat1
937.759 --> 941.839  but players are getting on the
939.24 --> 944.759  scoreboard uh this is Anna muuk from
941.839 --> 947.0790000000001  Ukraine versus nurul salimova from
944.759 --> 950.519  Bulgaria actually funny story about this
947.079 --> 952.0  match uh Nuru beat Anna to qualify for
950.519 --> 954.5600000000001  this tournament so they played in the
952.0 --> 958.44  Women's World Cup and uh this one is a
954.56 --> 960.4799999999999  Petro okay next game no uh Jokes Aside
958.44 --> 962.36  this one was was a weird sideline of the
960.48 --> 965.5600000000001  Petro where white gives up the pawn in
962.36 --> 967.48  the center and develops uh but uh yeah
965.56 --> 969.88  they traded and it's a middle game where
967.48 --> 971.9200000000001  white has some activity but white did
969.88 --> 974.36  not get a whole lot in this game uh
971.92 --> 976.399  White tried and pushed and right around
974.36 --> 978.399  here kind of had an active position like
976.399 --> 980.36  I think nuril was a bit on the back foot
978.399 --> 982.8  it was a little bit unpleasant and white
980.36 --> 984.9590000000001  definitely was more active but nuril was
982.8 --> 986.319  defending and I'm really not sure Anna
984.959 --> 988.92  could have done much better this is a
986.319 --> 990.8389999999999  very very well-timed idea by black
988.92 --> 992.399  making white either open up the position
990.839 --> 995.0400000000001  or do what she did in the game which is
992.399 --> 997.44  allow the pawn all the way down but yeah
995.04 --> 1000.24  Rook d8 strong counterplay trades the
997.44 --> 1001.9200000000001  pieces and uh good defense from Nuru
1000.24 --> 1003.36  honestly just a very good first round
1001.92 --> 1006.199  game for the candidates it's her first
1003.36 --> 1007.839  candidates I think she's uh 19 so she's
1006.199 --> 1010.04  the youngest participant on the women's
1007.839 --> 1014.44  side the second youngest being Vali who
1010.04 --> 1016.959  is 21 or 22 I think she's 22 and yeah 19
1014.44 --> 1019.6  years of age first game is a draw
1016.959 --> 1022.04  against uh I mean a perennial top five
1019.6 --> 1024.319  woman of the last like 10 years and a
1022.04 --> 1026.3999999999999  muuk so really not not much uh better
1024.319 --> 1027.48  you could ask for but a lot of draws as
1026.4 --> 1029.199  you can see like round one was
1027.48 --> 1031.199  relatively peaceful but the last couple
1029.199 --> 1033.72  of games are anything but peaceful this
1031.199 --> 1034.88  is Vali rames Babu sister of Prague
1033.72 --> 1037.52  brother and sister playing in the
1034.88 --> 1039.5590000000002  candidates versus humpy conu who is a
1037.52 --> 1042.36  legend of the game I mean she has been
1039.559 --> 1043.52  also perennial like top player and it's
1042.36 --> 1045.36  very cool that these different
1043.52 --> 1047.8799999999999  Generations are clashing from the same
1045.36 --> 1049.559  country like for Vali I mean I'm not
1047.88 --> 1051.2800000000002  putting words in her mouth
1049.559 --> 1053.36  that's not my intention but I can
1051.28 --> 1055.6399999999999  imagine maybe humpy was like even a role
1053.36 --> 1058.52  model or somebody she looked at as the
1055.64 --> 1060.64  icon of the nation right uh and this one
1058.52 --> 1063.6399999999999  is an Italian where white gets a lot of
1060.64 --> 1066.5590000000002  queenside space Italian is one of the
1063.64 --> 1069.24  most topical openings nowadays uh H6 is
1066.559 --> 1072.3999999999999  one of the ways to um to play and so is
1069.24 --> 1074.36  G6 you play like H6 G6 white can play in
1072.4 --> 1078.5590000000002  a handful of ways castling is one of the
1074.36 --> 1079.36  ways uh but uh you could also play H6
1078.559 --> 1082.9189999999999  like
1079.36 --> 1084.7199999999998  uh way back here like Knight F6 D3 H6
1082.919 --> 1086.5590000000002  this is also another way of playing but
1084.72 --> 1087.919  okay H6 and then Black's Bishop is
1086.559 --> 1090.08  forced back there if you want me to
1087.919 --> 1092.44  explain that to you I literally can't
1090.08 --> 1095.28  but this is the entire purpose black is
1092.44 --> 1097.28  trying to accomplish this move D5 uh and
1095.28 --> 1099.8799999999999  that is actually
1097.28 --> 1101.2  uh this is almost the reason why you you
1099.88 --> 1103.919  you you know you might castle and and
1101.2 --> 1105.3600000000001  play Rook e one first but now that black
1103.919 --> 1109.0800000000002  is able to play D5 you're going to kind
1105.36 --> 1110.84  of get an more open game A6 A3 and at
1109.08 --> 1112.72  some point the center will explode and
1110.84 --> 1114.799  there it goes and then the center
1112.72 --> 1116.559  explodes the pieces are traded humpy
1114.799 --> 1119.0  tries to approach on the on the uh Queen
1116.559 --> 1120.8799999999999  side a very nice idea here by Vali
1119.0 --> 1123.84  looking to secure some squares but a
1120.88 --> 1125.7600000000002  well-timed queen E6 and uh this might
1123.84 --> 1127.6399999999999  look really bad these pawns and I got to
1125.76 --> 1129.679  tell you they are a little ugly but they
1127.64 --> 1131.919  do the job and they completely stop any
1129.679 --> 1135.1200000000001  of White's ideas so she goes here
1131.919 --> 1136.76  instead but uh pressure was on for a
1135.12 --> 1138.9189999999999  little while but humpy defended very
1136.76 --> 1140.6  well kicked out the rook and then
1138.919 --> 1142.44  rotated the Knight rotated the queen it
1140.6 --> 1145.32  was a lot of rotations in this game and
1142.44 --> 1146.919  as you might imagine pieces were traded
1145.32 --> 1150.039  nobody's going to win this position and
1146.919 --> 1153.24  a peaceful resolution in the game by sh
1150.039 --> 1155.48  versus humpy as well
1153.24 --> 1158.919  but not in the last two games of this
1155.48 --> 1162.72  recap this is leting versus tongi and we
1158.919 --> 1164.679  will end with Ali Resa fua versus
1162.72 --> 1168.28  prananda ramish
1164.679 --> 1172.48  Babu leting is the uh defending winner
1168.28 --> 1173.8799999999999  of this tournament uh and um she uh she
1172.48 --> 1176.44  was the Challenger she was playing
1173.88 --> 1179.8400000000001  against J and Jun and tan also this
1176.44 --> 1181.559  Chinese wave of players uh they have to
1179.84 --> 1183.72  everybody from uh the same country plays
1181.559 --> 1186.76  in the first round at least they try to
1183.72 --> 1189.88  this one also starts out with D5 on the
1186.76 --> 1193.039  third move we saw that in the uh in this
1189.88 --> 1195.8400000000001  game in the game between AOSS of and
1193.039 --> 1197.32  nepo same exact concept same move order
1195.84 --> 1198.76  but this time we have an exchange so we
1197.32 --> 1199.799  have an exchange which is something that
1198.76 --> 1200.8799999999999  did not have in this game right that's
1199.799 --> 1202.84  why I said it was not an exchange
1200.88 --> 1205.919  variation and that allowed Yan to kind
1202.84 --> 1210.0  of simplify so leting plays uh The
1205.919 --> 1211.96  Exchange variation and now we'll play uh
1210.0 --> 1214.88  you know Queen C2 Bishop D3 Knight D2
1211.96 --> 1216.96  there's this plan but Tangi goes here
1214.88 --> 1218.44  and that is one of the rarest moves in
1216.96 --> 1220.3600000000001  the position which you might look at and
1218.44 --> 1222.48  go how is that how was that so rare it
1220.36 --> 1224.1999999999998  attacks the queen it looks very natural
1222.48 --> 1225.96  it looks weird because it allows Queen
1224.2 --> 1228.039  B3 attacking the pawn now this is reason
1225.96 --> 1230.8400000000001  Ling J you know she just plays Queen C2
1228.039 --> 1232.64  she kind of keeps moving but that is a
1230.84 --> 1236.1999999999998  weird place for the bishop especially
1232.64 --> 1237.919  cuz it could be a Target right so H3 and
1236.2 --> 1239.1200000000001  now the bishop goes back to E6 and white
1237.919 --> 1240.48  just sort of plays I mean white just
1239.12 --> 1243.0  says all right like whatever you wanted
1240.48 --> 1245.64  the bishop there and now tanong he plays
1243.0 --> 1247.48  this trading the bishop so she's looking
1245.64 --> 1249.679  for kind of an
1247.48 --> 1252.52  immediate simplification in some
1249.679 --> 1256.4  capacity right we have Knight takes
1252.52 --> 1259.039  C4 if this was played and then this you
1256.4 --> 1261.2800000000002  can't take it looks like you can Queen B
1259.039 --> 1262.84  before but actually as it turns out you
1261.28 --> 1264.36  can play like this the uh the engine
1262.84 --> 1265.9599999999998  actually doesn't really mind it black
1264.36 --> 1267.4799999999998  will be able to get back into the game
1265.96 --> 1270.6000000000001  but you kind of don't want to enter the
1267.48 --> 1273.279  dra you know the Lions then so leting J
1270.6 --> 1275.36  just trades some pieces plays very
1273.279 --> 1278.159  solidly and here I thought has an
1275.36 --> 1281.8799999999999  excellent position right she has a great
1278.159 --> 1286.7990000000002  position uh and I have something in my
1281.88 --> 1289.24  eyeball so B4 all right Rook
1286.799 --> 1290.32  E8 castles
1289.24 --> 1293.84  Queen
1290.32 --> 1296.279  G5 this is a threat so white goes here
1293.84 --> 1298.1589999999999  and white plays B5 and Ling J is just
1296.279 --> 1300.36  bulldozing the queen side this is what's
1298.159 --> 1302.0390000000002  called a queen side uh minority versus a
1300.36 --> 1304.039  Queens side majority it's three pawns
1302.039 --> 1305.84  versus four and you're just trying to
1304.039 --> 1309.12  kind of go down that side of the board
1305.84 --> 1311.9599999999998  and break trying to get A4 A5 A6 crack
1309.12 --> 1313.9599999999998  these pawns get in win the game Rook e
1311.96 --> 1316.48  six okay so black is trying to create
1313.96 --> 1319.279  counterplay while also playing defense
1316.48 --> 1321.279  uh now in this position
1319.279 --> 1322.799  BC is a little bit fast instead
1321.279 --> 1324.679  apparently this is a little bit better
1322.799 --> 1326.24  to kind of protect and then maybe
1324.679 --> 1328.279  regroup but it's a it's a very it's a
1326.24 --> 1329.52  very tense position Bishop F3 and still
1328.279 --> 1331.44  the position looks completely fine for
1329.52 --> 1334.44  white white is totally not in any danger
1331.44 --> 1335.8400000000001  Queen A5 Queen C7 Queen H4 but there's
1334.44 --> 1337.559  nothing I mean there's absolutely
1335.84 --> 1341.6  nothing
1337.559 --> 1343.44  um but here Lei uh gets a little bit
1341.6 --> 1347.0  spooked she obviously didn't like
1343.44 --> 1348.3200000000002  something here uh she didn't like this
1347.0 --> 1350.88  she did not like the prospect of that
1348.32 --> 1353.48  move move and what's kind of funny is
1350.88 --> 1357.24  that Rook C1 here is the best
1353.48 --> 1360.24  move and after Bishop H3 you just go
1357.24 --> 1362.279  Queen H2 so it doesn't quite work Rook
1360.24 --> 1366.76  C1 threatens Rook C6 so if black plays
1362.279 --> 1368.4  A6 you take if Bishop H3 you take and
1366.76 --> 1370.12  you're not getting M it and then at the
1368.4 --> 1372.919  end of the whole thing you play Queen H2
1370.12 --> 1374.6789999999999  right so Rook C1 going for this Pawn
1372.919 --> 1375.919  continuing with all of this would have
1374.679 --> 1378.72  been the right way but instead of that
1375.919 --> 1380.5200000000002  she kind of panics she goes here when 10
1378.72 --> 1382.76  minutes she trades the Queens thinking
1380.52 --> 1386.12  well this is solid I can't
1382.76 --> 1386.84  lose but suddenly it starts to spin out
1386.12 --> 1389.3999999999999  of
1386.84 --> 1391.6  control black plays very solidly very
1389.4 --> 1394.72  smart defensive
1391.6 --> 1396.76  chess and lay just loses a pawn takes
1394.72 --> 1397.919  this one but she loses that one she must
1396.76 --> 1399.84  have thought she was going to win one
1397.919 --> 1404.0  back here
1399.84 --> 1406.24  but black just is up a pawn and you know
1404.0 --> 1407.2  the engine is always thinking positions
1406.24 --> 1409.88  like this are
1407.2 --> 1412.799  drawish but as the game goes on and time
1409.88 --> 1414.8400000000001  gets low we see move 40 time is added
1412.799 --> 1416.9189999999999  black is winning I mean black is up a
1414.84 --> 1421.0  pawn and black is going to stop that one
1416.919 --> 1423.3200000000002  and and and and tanong just very slowly
1421.0 --> 1426.36  methodically look at this move G5 by the
1423.32 --> 1429.4399999999998  way setting a Checkmate net King's made
1426.36 --> 1432.12  it so white has to sacrifice and now
1429.44 --> 1434.96  it's all over the king is hunted out
1432.12 --> 1438.4399999999998  Rook A1 this is check the pawn is
1434.96 --> 1442.64  stopped King F3 and in this position
1438.44 --> 1446.48  after H4 Rook G8 uh Le resigns because
1442.64 --> 1449.2  she can protect her Pawn G4 H5 take take
1446.48 --> 1452.3600000000001  take and you will just lose this end
1449.2 --> 1454.2  game Crazy dongi wins she beats the
1452.36 --> 1456.1999999999998  defending Champion which leaves us with
1454.2 --> 1459.159  the probably the most exciting game of
1456.2 --> 1462.24  the round alira fua versus prag the
1459.159 --> 1466.44  battle of the young uh the young men and
1462.24 --> 1469.679  uh Aliva 20 I think or 21 uh 20 I think
1466.44 --> 1471.039  he's 20 he might be 21 born in 2003 so
1469.679 --> 1473.0  there's a higher chance that he's 20
1471.039 --> 1473.919  than 21 unless he's born in the earlier
1473.0 --> 1475.96  part of the year but I think he's born
1473.919 --> 1479.2  in June but I might be wrong anyway and
1475.96 --> 1483.48  Prague is like 12 uh no Prague is uh 17
1479.2 --> 1486.279  he's 18 Spanish pish four and now not
1483.48 --> 1488.84  just any Spanish the open Spanish the
1486.279 --> 1494.919  Spanish where you take and everything
1488.84 --> 1497.08  goes crazy D4 B5 D5 takes Bishop E6
1494.919 --> 1499.0800000000002  Cutting Edge theory on the board Bishop
1497.08 --> 1502.12  C2 Queen E1
1499.08 --> 1504.36  oh my goodness unpinning allowing your
1502.12 --> 1506.76  king to be opened up and oiled up Knight
1504.36 --> 1508.799  bd2 Knight E6 the king slides out of the
1506.76 --> 1510.2  way and you know why the king slides out
1508.799 --> 1511.799  of the way because the king knows that
1510.2 --> 1513.159  when this opens up the Rook is going to
1511.799 --> 1514.8799999999999  the G file that's exactly what happens
1513.159 --> 1517.7600000000002  and you notice neither guy is thinking
1514.88 --> 1519.3990000000001  much Bishop G5 both guys playing on the
1517.76 --> 1520.6  ideas that they are familiar with the
1519.399 --> 1521.84  bishop goes there you know why it goes
1520.6 --> 1524.039  there cuz you're trying to get rid of
1521.84 --> 1525.1999999999998  White's Bishop which is a super weird
1524.039 --> 1526.72  idea but you know what the idea do you
1525.2 --> 1528.159  know what the actual idea of Bishop G5
1526.72 --> 1529.64  is do you know why the bishop went out
1528.159 --> 1532.3600000000001  there there to
1529.64 --> 1535.3600000000001  trade because Black's Bishop was
1532.36 --> 1537.76  Superfluous there was nowhere to put it
1535.36 --> 1539.7199999999998  the black queen wanted to activate but
1537.76 --> 1542.6  you're not going to put your Bishop on
1539.72 --> 1544.88  C5 so instead you trade the bishop and
1542.6 --> 1546.84  then you play Queen H4 and both guys are
1544.88 --> 1548.7990000000002  implementing the game plan it's a very
1546.84 --> 1551.32  imbalanced game what is going Rook G4
1548.799 --> 1553.279  the queen is just hanging around eyes on
1551.32 --> 1555.4399999999998  here eyes on here eyes on the king
1553.279 --> 1558.36  Knight D3 Queen E2 and I mean it looks
1555.44 --> 1559.8400000000001  like Ali resa is about to just go
1558.36 --> 1562.6399999999999  straight down the board and he's got a
1559.84 --> 1566.4399999999998  20-minute time Advantage but Prague well
1562.64 --> 1569.0  timed F5 a Counter Strike getting an on
1566.44 --> 1571.279  pant in but now he brings in his Rook
1569.0 --> 1573.559  Ali Resa plays F4 the pawn is on the way
1571.279 --> 1574.96  Rook G7 an idea it doesn't work you
1573.559 --> 1577.279  don't win the queen because this is
1574.96 --> 1579.44  there but it's an idea Rook
1577.279 --> 1581.88  H6 that's Checkmate you got to do
1579.44 --> 1584.1200000000001  something about it how about this move
1581.88 --> 1585.0800000000002  Queen playing defense Here Comes Prague
1584.12 --> 1587.399  with his other
1585.08 --> 1589.399  Rook now here's the thing if this ever
1587.399 --> 1591.559  goes to an end game
1589.399 --> 1593.1589999999999  like let's just say something like this
1591.559 --> 1595.039  black is always better black is better
1593.159 --> 1597.8400000000001  because these pawns are terrible they're
1595.039 --> 1599.76  not good so white really needs to keep
1597.84 --> 1604.32  pieces on the board the right way Rook e
1599.76 --> 1608.399  one a very very tense game Rook H5 now
1604.32 --> 1610.1589999999999  Ali Resa decides A4 Ali Resa has half
1608.399 --> 1612.039  less than half the time of his opponent
1610.159 --> 1613.44  and he has 12 minutes to make 13 moves
1612.039 --> 1615.679  you know Co Els had 12 minutes to make
1613.44 --> 1617.919  13 moves remember this guy over here
1615.679 --> 1619.3200000000002  Fabiano Luigi Carana yes his middle name
1617.919 --> 1621.0  is luig IGI I'm not just I'm not just
1619.32 --> 1623.1589999999999  talking about Mario and Luigi he looks
1621.0 --> 1625.08  like his middle name is Luigi all right
1623.159 --> 1627.0800000000002  yeah TW he also had 12 minutes for for
1625.08 --> 1628.76  13 moves and what did F do he started
1627.08 --> 1629.8799999999999  trading because he was like you know
1628.76 --> 1631.52  what I got to relieve the tension a
1629.88 --> 1634.64  little bit simplify H res says I'm
1631.52 --> 1636.279  opening up a new front of attack Rook H6
1634.64 --> 1637.279  there's there's like really brutal stuff
1636.279 --> 1641.039  that's going to happen over here rookie
1637.279 --> 1643.72  two five minutes he has five minutes to
1641.039 --> 1645.1589999999999  make 12 moves there's no bonus time he
1643.72 --> 1646.76  has five minutes to make 12 moves do you
1645.159 --> 1648.2  understand 12 moves is a lot of moves
1646.76 --> 1649.279  and then you might play bullet or Blitz
1648.2 --> 1652.0  that's a lot of moves it's the
1649.279 --> 1655.64  candidates a lot is on the line Rook H3
1652.0 --> 1657.88  the queen goes back this is a free Pawn
1655.64 --> 1661.64  but believe it or not it might be better
1657.88 --> 1663.7990000000002  to go here to keep the tension to force
1661.64 --> 1666.44  white to play defense and maybe even
1663.799 --> 1669.519  play a move like B4 giving up a pawn to
1666.44 --> 1671.159  secure the D4 Square I mean is a very
1669.519 --> 1673.2  big moment in this game it's the first
1671.159 --> 1675.5590000000002  game of the candidates do you go all in
1673.2 --> 1677.72  do you do do you not go all in he takes
1675.559 --> 1681.279  the Free Pawn but by taking the Free
1677.72 --> 1683.519  Pawn Al res jums to C5 oh my God you
1681.279 --> 1684.6  can't take and the Knight is hanging you
1683.519 --> 1687.24  can't take because rookie e eight you
1684.6 --> 1690.76  lose your queen Rook is game over it's
1687.24 --> 1693.039  lights out so is alira winning a
1690.76 --> 1695.12  well-timed strike Queen H5 the Knight is
1693.039 --> 1697.679  completely abandoned but maid is still
1695.12 --> 1699.799  there if the Rook moves and The Rook is
1697.679 --> 1702.44  hanging and now the best move is Rook
1699.799 --> 1703.399  EEG G2 bringing in the queen with
1702.44 --> 1705.159  pressure on the jeep that would have
1703.399 --> 1707.6789999999999  been the best move and Prague would have
1705.159 --> 1711.24  had to find the unfathomable the only
1707.679 --> 1714.279  move Knight E5 giving up the Knight
1711.24 --> 1716.08  completely but the point is the queen is
1714.279 --> 1718.0  now blocked and then he would have had
1716.08 --> 1720.559  to find Queen F7 giving up a knight
1718.0 --> 1722.399  completely with Rook what is this how is
1720.559 --> 1724.76  that what what about Bishop D yeah but
1722.399 --> 1727.76  the Knight is hanging that's the real
1724.76 --> 1729.32  problem so if in this position alira had
1727.76 --> 1730.559  played Rook G2 Prague would have had to
1729.32 --> 1733.24  find the only move Knight E5 I don't
1730.559 --> 1736.2  know if he saw it or what but instead of
1733.24 --> 1738.64  that with low time he goes here Knight
1736.2 --> 1741.48  G5 and the dust settles
1738.64 --> 1744.1200000000001  with a rook sacrifice and a Perpetual
1741.48 --> 1747.159  check in the final position Prague is
1744.12 --> 1749.8799999999999  down a knight and a bishop a knight and
1747.159 --> 1751.96  a bishop but white cannot Escape he
1749.88 --> 1755.3200000000002  cannot Escape The Vortex of checks
1751.96 --> 1757.88  nobody can defend and the game ends in a
1755.32 --> 1759.399  draw oh my goodness so seven out of
1757.88 --> 1762.3200000000002  eight games in the first round ended in
1759.399 --> 1765.12  draws this one was ridiculous most of
1762.32 --> 1766.84  the games were pretty kind of boring is
1765.12 --> 1769.559  you know just kind of easing into it the
1766.84 --> 1771.279  Fai hearo game was back and forth hikaro
1769.559 --> 1774.2  played uh very practically well in that
1771.279 --> 1776.6  game posing some problems for Fabiano to
1774.2 --> 1778.48  convert Fabi was never endanger in that
1776.6 --> 1780.6  game but to convert any type of
1778.48 --> 1782.76  advantage that he had and tanang the
1780.6 --> 1784.039  only winner of the day leads uh the
1782.76 --> 1785.48  women's candidates with one point but
1784.039 --> 1788.64  you you don't you don't need to know all
1785.48 --> 1790.919  of that you we got 13 more rounds to go
1788.64 --> 1794.3600000000001  uh all courses are 33% off during the
1790.919 --> 1795.919  candidate sale and um do check out the
1794.36 --> 1799.0  interviews I will be rolling out all the
1795.919 --> 1802.72  interviews with Yan pishi uh I recorded
1799.0 --> 1805.32  a second one with Hikaru Vish Anand I'm
1802.72 --> 1808.559  super stoked super excited and you know
1805.32 --> 1808.559  the drill get out of here
