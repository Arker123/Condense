0.06 --> 2.7600000000000002  [Music]
0.12 --> 4.74  did you know that roughly 300 million
2.76 --> 7.56  people are affected by color blindness
4.74 --> 10.379999999999999  it averages out to about 1 in 12 males
7.56 --> 12.54  and one in 200 females are affected by
10.38 --> 14.280000000000001  some kind of color vision deficiency did
12.54 --> 17.52  you know that tens is one of them high
14.28 --> 19.56  intense and I'm colorblind yep he's got
17.52 --> 21.66  prot anomaly which means that he has
19.56 --> 23.038999999999998  trouble seeing greens and pinks pretty
21.66 --> 24.6  interesting that one of the best players
23.039 --> 26.64  in the world sees the game differently
24.6 --> 29.580000000000002  than you and me that got us thinking
26.64 --> 30.66  what does valorant look like to tens in
29.58 --> 32.22  a bit we're going to show you some
30.66 --> 34.8  examples of what valorent does look like
32.22 --> 37.14  to Ted's but first it's important we
34.8 --> 38.94  understand what color blindness is and
37.14 --> 41.219  how it affects people that's why we
38.94 --> 43.8  spoke to an actual optometrist
41.219 --> 45.42  my name is Dr Joseph Allen kind of
43.8 --> 48.0  specializing in ocular disease
45.42 --> 50.160000000000004  especially in dry eye Dr Allen has been
48.0 --> 51.96  practicing Optometry for eight years and
50.16 --> 53.76  for the last four years has been
51.96 --> 56.219  creating YouTube content on his channel
53.76 --> 59.76  Dr Eye Health educating millions of
56.219 --> 62.399  people so the the proper term is color
59.76 --> 64.979  vision deficiency most people aren't
62.399 --> 68.93900000000001  truly colorblind a person who is truly
64.979 --> 70.92  colorblind we call Rod monochromacy so
68.939 --> 73.979  they literally see a world in black and
70.92 --> 76.02  white which is very rare in other words
73.979 --> 76.979  color vision deficiency is this where
76.02 --> 81.53999999999999  people
76.979 --> 84.17999999999999  some people will see colors not
81.54 --> 88.14  the same way as most other normal people
84.18 --> 91.2  do so color vision deficiency most often
88.14 --> 94.74  occurs just due to genetics a normal
91.2 --> 97.86  human retina has three cones three
94.74 --> 99.53999999999999  photoreceptor types one type is long
97.86 --> 102.42  wavelengths of Light which is more of
99.54 --> 105.06  red there's green cones which are more
102.42 --> 106.86  kind of middle medium length wavelengths
105.06 --> 108.78  and then there's short wavelengths which
106.86 --> 111.479  are the blue colors they're blue cones
108.78 --> 116.119  so most people who have color vision
111.479 --> 118.439  deficiency are what we call anomalous
116.119 --> 121.799  trichromats that means that they still
118.439 --> 124.25899999999999  have three cones but one of their cones
121.799 --> 126.659  they don't have enough of them or as
124.259 --> 129.119  many or they're just not as sensitive
126.659 --> 130.679  all this info from Dr Allen brings up an
129.119 --> 132.72  interesting question how do you know if
130.679 --> 134.22  you're colorblind I mean you've been
132.72 --> 135.9  seeing the way you see your whole life
134.22 --> 137.879  you would never know unless you went to
135.9 --> 139.98000000000002  an optometrist and were tested tense has
137.879 --> 142.2  a funny story about this there's a few
139.98 --> 143.57999999999998  instances in my life where I guess I was
142.2 --> 145.92  kind of like
143.58 --> 147.66000000000003  what's going on here one was when I was
145.92 --> 149.45899999999997  really young and I kind of heard this
147.66 --> 150.959  from my mom but we were like shopping
149.459 --> 152.459  for pencil boxes because that's what you
150.959 --> 154.739  do when you're in elementary school you
152.459 --> 156.66  get a pencil box and I went up to like a
154.739 --> 158.4  hot pink one and I said Mom I want the
156.66 --> 160.92  blue one and I was like holding it and
158.4 --> 163.14000000000001  like she's like that's like pink and
160.92 --> 165.72  then the I guess like the other moments
163.14 --> 167.45899999999997  was me going to the optometrist finally
165.72 --> 169.14  and getting like glasses for my first
167.459 --> 171.12  time I think it was like grade five and
169.14 --> 173.16  it's like that chart or not chart but
171.12 --> 174.959  it's like this uh test that you do where
173.16 --> 178.2  there's like a number hidden in between
174.959 --> 179.879  all the bubbles I don't see anything
178.2 --> 182.099  I'll say nothing because it is nothing
179.879 --> 184.07999999999998  and you have to guess or not guess oh
182.099 --> 186.599  for me it's guessing but you have to
184.08 --> 187.92000000000002  like see the number and I just never I
186.599 --> 190.01899999999998  can never tell what number it is it's
187.92 --> 192.05999999999997  like impossible for me so while we're
190.019 --> 195.14000000000001  here let's take a quick second to see if
192.06 --> 195.14000000000001  you actually are colorblind
195.78 --> 198.54  so now that we've got a basic
197.099 --> 200.34  understanding of color blindness and
198.54 --> 201.9  have run through a test let's get to the
200.34 --> 205.099  reason you clicked on this video how
201.9 --> 205.09900000000002  does valorent look to tens
217.019 --> 221.28  pretty crazy huh you can imagine how
219.36 --> 223.26000000000002  this would affect tenza's gameplay the
221.28 --> 225.72  red outline around players turns into a
223.26 --> 227.7  murky Brown an enemy jet up drafting
225.72 --> 230.04  against the Blue Sky just Fades into
227.7 --> 232.379  gray the little shading on smokes to say
230.04 --> 234.78  which team threw it down just disappears
232.379 --> 237.239  but don't take my word for it let's hear
234.78 --> 240.0  it from tens himself I did have issues
237.239 --> 242.4  with like right now in valorant because
240.0 --> 243.959  I use yellow outlines I can't have a
242.4 --> 245.94  green or yellow Crosser because it'll
243.959 --> 248.519  quite literally blend in for me so
245.94 --> 250.26  that's why I've been using cyan I'm not
248.519 --> 251.22  sure about abilities in general but I
250.26 --> 252.54  remember when I was first playing
251.22 --> 254.819  ballerant and I was trying out the red
252.54 --> 256.62  outlines it was really really hard for
254.819 --> 258.71999999999997  me to see anything like I just wouldn't
256.62 --> 261.18  see any of the models the yellow ones do
258.72 --> 262.86  pop up to me like a lot more and it's a
261.18 --> 264.479  lot easier for my eyes to catch but
262.86 --> 266.699  things that do [ __ ] me up when I'm using
264.479 --> 268.8  the yellow lines is if I go into a
266.699 --> 270.41900000000004  Viper's pit because like for some reason
268.8 --> 272.52000000000004  like green and yellow look the exact
270.419 --> 273.96  same to me so I kind of have to like go
272.52 --> 275.69899999999996  off like the gun model or the actual
273.96 --> 277.919  model itself rather than like an outline
275.699 --> 280.199  another thing is I can't really tell
277.919 --> 283.56  when it's an enemy smoke and my
280.199 --> 286.62  teammates smoke because I think there's
283.56 --> 288.6  a red tint on enemy smokes and I quite
286.62 --> 290.4  literally cannot see it yeah I don't
288.6 --> 293.16  know the exact same I don't see anything
290.4 --> 294.96  that's interesting what ten said
293.16 --> 297.24  can you tell the difference
294.96 --> 297.96  if not you might want to go get checked
297.24 --> 299.52  out
297.96 --> 300.71999999999997  thankfully Riot has included some
299.52 --> 302.94  accessibility options to help
300.72 --> 304.97900000000004  accommodate players with color blindness
302.94 --> 307.44  I I do play with the accessibility
304.979 --> 309.9  feature on valorant to make my outlines
307.44 --> 312.06  yellow so it's the proton feature and
309.9 --> 313.79999999999995  it's for the like red green color
312.06 --> 315.96  blindness while the accessibility
313.8 --> 317.22  features do help it's interesting that
315.96 --> 319.19899999999996  there are still some parts of the game
317.22 --> 321.0  it can't correct for it could be that
319.199 --> 322.5  making such drastic changes to the color
321.0 --> 324.96  palette of the game could lead to some
322.5 --> 327.539  unexpected advantages but Dr Allen has a
324.96 --> 329.58  solution for that an interesting kind of
327.539 --> 331.919  tidbit though some people who have
329.58 --> 335.039  especially dichromacy from a young age
331.919 --> 337.979  maybe tens he's learned what red means
335.039 --> 342.419  to him and a lot of people have learned
337.979 --> 347.46  to adapt by learning other subtle cues
342.419 --> 349.139  they learn textures better than relying
347.46 --> 351.23999999999995  on color because maybe if your normal
349.139 --> 353.22  color vision you may be like oh well
351.24 --> 355.38  it's red it's obviously red I don't need
353.22 --> 358.02000000000004  to put the brain power into learning the
355.38 --> 359.88  texture or how light bounces off the
358.02 --> 361.919  surface of that object the interesting
359.88 --> 363.9  thing I think is depending on the game
361.919 --> 365.94  because a lot of game developers use
363.9 --> 368.21999999999997  it's really like a flat wall with a
365.94 --> 370.62  texture on top right there's really no
368.22 --> 372.06  3D depth so depending on where the
370.62 --> 374.46  lighting is used in the game they may
372.06 --> 377.1  see a shadow I'm not sure if there's any
374.46 --> 379.25899999999996  research to kind of show if a color
377.1 --> 381.24  vision deficient individual would be
379.259 --> 383.639  able to really detect those differences
381.24 --> 385.979  but there may be a scenario where tens
383.639 --> 388.259  may have in some ways an advantage
385.979 --> 390.9  because his eyes are tuned to those
388.259 --> 392.58000000000004  subtle little differences Dr Allen
390.9 --> 394.02  brings up an interesting point that
392.58 --> 395.699  there are things other than adjusting
394.02 --> 397.79999999999995  color tones that could help color
395.699 --> 399.3  deficient Gamers you know how tens was
397.8 --> 401.40000000000003  saying he has trouble differentiating
399.3 --> 403.62  his team's smoke versus the enemy smoke
401.4 --> 405.539  what if your team smoke was a different
403.62 --> 407.699  texture than the enemies or in this
405.539 --> 409.86  example rotated the opposite direction
407.699 --> 411.66  it sounds like a simple enough solution
409.86 --> 413.699  hopefully Riot is working on something
411.66 --> 415.5  like that so that all Gamers can compete
413.699 --> 418.56  on an even playing field
415.5 --> 420.24  have you tried the the glasses I have
418.56 --> 421.56  did it does it do it I actually know
420.24 --> 423.3  this it's kind of crazy to me really
421.56 --> 425.16  yeah Kade actually bought me the glasses
423.3 --> 427.68  and I was looking at the sky and I was
425.16 --> 429.66  like holy [ __ ] I've never seen like the
427.68 --> 432.84000000000003  sky has so many shades to it
429.66 --> 434.699  like like to me because I'm really bad
432.84 --> 436.38  with Shades and like colors when they're
434.699 --> 438.18  all together they blend in for me I
436.38 --> 440.099  guess but I was looking at the sky for
438.18 --> 441.24  just like [ __ ] 30 minutes straight
440.099 --> 443.099  I'm just like looking at it I'm just
441.24 --> 445.8  like wow there's so many colors in the
443.099 --> 448.4  sky like this is so amazing I see yeah I
445.8 --> 448.40000000000003  start crying
449.419 --> 455.039  no it's weird because
452.52 --> 457.31899999999996  um the glasses they kind of make all my
455.039 --> 459.419  other colors seem weird but I get to see
457.319 --> 460.97900000000004  more so like my range becomes bigger but
459.419 --> 462.35999999999996  like what I normally see becomes
460.979 --> 464.28  different but I don't even know if
462.36 --> 466.02000000000004  that's what I don't know what I see as
464.28 --> 468.65999999999997  normal I don't know if like getting into
466.02 --> 470.21999999999997  like Illuminati shirt I don't know
468.66 --> 471.59900000000005  is anybody struggling with color
470.22 --> 473.759  blindness make sure you use
471.599 --> 475.74  accessibility mode and valorence make
473.759 --> 477.47900000000004  your outlines a different colors so you
475.74 --> 479.58  can actually see them make sure you read
477.479 --> 481.68  the the label on the crowns or the
479.58 --> 485.18  pencil crowns that says what color it is
481.68 --> 485.18  other than that good luck
