0.066 --> 2.8689999999999998  We just got dropped off
in the middle of an abandoned city.
2.969 --> 4.938  And we're going to spend the next
seven days here.
4.971 --> 6.406000000000001  And there goes our only way out.
6.439 --> 8.742  We're now stranded
for the next seven days.
10.71 --> 11.578000000000001  Why are we doing this?
12.212 --> 12.779  For content.
12.812 --> 16.082  This once beautiful city
was bombed an abandoned
16.082 --> 16.916  because of war,
16.916 --> 19.886  which means the only people here
are us and our cameraman.
19.953 --> 21.121  At least that we know of.
21.121 --> 23.288999999999998  So I guess we start off
by getting off the roof.
23.39 --> 26.159  We knew that our first objective
was to explore this city
26.192 --> 29.529  and find a safe place to call home
for the next seven days,
29.629 --> 31.664  which starts
with exploring this building
31.698 --> 34.2  All right, let's see what's down
the bottom of this building.
34.2 --> 36.636  I assume under this wood is a floor.
36.669 --> 38.270999999999994  Only one way to find out.
38.271 --> 40.44  All right, this is crazy.
40.607 --> 42.542  I feel like I'm
in a zombie apocalypse.
42.542 --> 43.476  This is wild.
43.476 --> 44.611  Oh, look at this.
44.611 --> 46.046  After a little more exploring,
46.046 --> 48.647999999999996  we stumbled upon an area
that might work for our shelter.
48.681 --> 49.748999999999995  Oh, my Gosh.
49.749 --> 51.718  I think this is where
we should set up camp.
51.718 --> 54.087  You can see the entire city
over here.
54.32 --> 56.356  Plus, we have a
roof to protect us from rain.
57.39 --> 59.259  And now that we
had our home base decided,
59.292 --> 60.56  the next step was to open up
60.56 --> 63.363  the supplies crate left
by the helicopter on the roof.
63.463 --> 65.231  Let's pop open this crate
so we can build camp.
65.231 --> 66.833  We need some gear.
68.668 --> 70.67  This crate contains
all of the survival gear
70.67 --> 72.105  we'll need for the next seven days.
72.105 --> 74.34  And so we don't have to carry stuff
all the way down the stairs.
74.374 --> 75.57499999999999  We're just going to drop it.
78.878 --> 79.879  Chandler.
80.814 --> 82.54899999999999  We have a perfect assembly line.
82.549 --> 84.384  Kris, it's raining
sleeping bags.
86.386 --> 88.42099999999999  Chandler, there's our dinner plates.
88.421 --> 90.09  Wait, Chandler don't let it fall.
90.356 --> 91.357  Chandler.
91.391 --> 93.159  Yeah!
93.259 --> 95.462  That was the coolest thing we've ever done.
95.495 --> 98.765  But jokes aside, it was time
to actually start surviving now.
98.898 --> 100.26599999999999  Who wants fire
duty?
100.266 --> 101.56800000000001  - We'll get it.
- We're on bed duty.
101.601 --> 103.803  Kris got started on making a fire
with Mark.
103.837 --> 106.673  I'm personally a fan of the log
cabin when it comes to fires.
106.706 --> 108.408  Eagle Scout.
Did I mention that yet?
109.843 --> 112.545  While Chandler and I look
for something for us to sleep on.
112.579 --> 114.514  This is what mattresses
were like a hundred years ago?
114.848 --> 115.982  Wait, you found a mattress?
115.982 --> 116.85  - Yeah.
- Where?
116.883 --> 118.21799999999999  On the second floor
in a corner.
120.92 --> 122.288  - That's all you.
- Thanks.
122.322 --> 123.59  You should wrap
that thing in a tarp
123.59 --> 124.791  so you don't get destroyed by bugs.
124.824 --> 126.493  I'm going to wrap
that mattress like a burrito.
126.659 --> 129.329  And while Chandler took us chances
with a sketchy mattress,
129.429 --> 132.298  The rest of us decided
to sleep on wooden doors.
132.565 --> 134.901  There's no shot that you're
more comfortable than me right now.
135.635 --> 136.736  My back already hurts.
136.736 --> 139.539  There are so many buildings
we have yet to explore in the city.
139.572 --> 140.874  Tomorrow's going to be insane.
141.307 --> 142.208  We'll see you in the morning.
142.775 --> 145.345  Even though our first day in
the city went pretty smooth.
145.411 --> 148.481  Something eerie did happen to occur
later that night.
148.615 --> 149.749  While we were sleeping,
149.782 --> 151.251  Mark and some of the camera guys
151.251 --> 153.453  woke up to the sound
of breaking glass
153.486 --> 154.754  not far from the camp.
158.391 --> 159.826  Which made us start to wonder
159.826 --> 161.828  if we were really alone
inside the city.
162.162 --> 162.79500000000002  What was it?
163.129 --> 164.297  We just heard glass shattering there.
164.33 --> 166.032  I thought I saw something.
166.032 --> 167.8  But on top of the freaky noises,
167.834 --> 170.236  this first shelter was way
too windy to sleep.
170.27 --> 171.304  How'd you guys sleep?
171.938 --> 172.438  Bad.
172.472 --> 175.275  So in pursuit of better sleep,
we got up, got breakfast
175.441 --> 177.243  and prepare to find our new shelter.
177.243 --> 179.412  This is the first time
I've had chili for breakfast.
179.412 --> 181.281  But I'm so hungry,
I kind of don't care.
181.314 --> 182.28199999999998  Well, since the raft.
182.315 --> 184.517  When have I ever been
this excited over canned chili?
184.517 --> 186.319  I think my brain tried
to forget about that. Thanks.
186.319 --> 189.22199999999998  So after a nutritious breakfast,
we took off our drone
189.222 --> 191.72400000000002  to seek out a new shelter
in the unexplored buildings.
191.758 --> 193.15900000000002  We haven't explored that building.
193.159 --> 194.79399999999998  We haven't explored those hotels.
194.794 --> 196.496  It is an actual city here.
196.496 --> 198.33100000000002  However, upon
scanning the buildings,
198.331 --> 200.5  we did stumble upon
an unexpected guest.
200.5 --> 202.302  - There's a cat.
- There's a cat down there.
202.302 --> 204.37  I'm going to land the drone
right beside the cat.
206.105 --> 206.97299999999998  Look at that shot.
207.207 --> 209.509  Kris, Kris, look,
it's sniffing the camera.
209.542 --> 211.511  This cat has no survival instinct.
211.511 --> 214.113  I promise we are not paying
this cat to be an actor.
214.113 --> 216.983  As fun as playing with these cats
is, we need to focus on shelter
216.983 --> 218.151  because it's
going to be freezing tonight.
218.151 --> 219.352  And so we started our journey
219.352 --> 221.321  to find a sufficient shelter
for the challenge.
222.088 --> 223.289  Wait, what is this?
224.557 --> 225.59199999999998  This is pretty.
225.992 --> 228.528  It just has this type of
like aesthetic to it,
228.561 --> 230.63  that is like beautiful
even though it's ugly.
230.63 --> 232.065  Zombie apocalypse aesthetic.
232.565 --> 233.399  Yeah. There you go.
233.533 --> 234.968  Wait, is that a pool?
236.002 --> 236.869  What the heck?
236.869 --> 238.404  This is so eerie.
238.404 --> 241.174  Back in the day,
this used to look something like this.
241.207 --> 242.17499999999998  And after decades
242.175 --> 245.51100000000002  of rotting from being abandoned,
this is what we're left with.
245.612 --> 247.146  Wait, there's a soccer field?
247.18 --> 248.91500000000002  The sports court.
249.549 --> 250.817  Is that a soccer ball?
252.218 --> 252.885  I almost died.
252.885 --> 255.088  I bet this soccer ball
is older than me.
255.255 --> 257.257  Older than all of us, for sure.
257.257 --> 259.058  Well, besides, Mark,
he's old.
259.058 --> 259.993  We have two options now.
259.993 --> 262.462  We can keep exploring
down this cool looking tunnel
262.495 --> 263.763  and go check
out the neighborhood.
263.763 --> 265.99899999999997  Or with the hour of light we have left,
265.999 --> 268.30100000000004  we can prep for nighttime
and not freeze all night.
268.301 --> 270.27  - Not freeze.
- That sounds like a good idea.
270.27 --> 270.73699999999997  I agree.
270.737 --> 273.57300000000004  And after spending the entire day
looking for a new shelter,
273.573 --> 276.342  I just can't get over
how massive the city is.
276.376 --> 279.212  We finally found a place
fortified enough to call home.
279.512 --> 280.68  So we don't freeze tonight.
280.68 --> 283.216  We're thinking of setting up camp
in this room right here.
283.216 --> 284.817  We'll have a fire pit right here.
284.851 --> 287.487  We can tarp the wall right there.
It's going to be comfy.
287.487 --> 288.755  Yeah, Mark's
going to do all that.
288.788 --> 289.889  I said we.
289.922 --> 291.49100000000004  The only hard part is,
come over here.
291.491 --> 294.627  Our current camp and all our gear
is all the way over there.
294.661 --> 296.229  I hope this place really works out
296.229 --> 297.83  because it's going to be
a lot of effort to set up.
297.83 --> 300.4  With the sun getting low and
the temperature rapidly dropping.
300.433 --> 302.402  We made our way back
to the old camping spot
302.402 --> 304.337  and packed up
to settle into the new base.
304.337 --> 306.539  We're headed into the new campsite.
306.572 --> 308.44100000000003  The new camp, the new camp.
308.441 --> 309.409  The new camp.
309.442 --> 312.512  Okay, we've got a lot of cleanup
to do to prep this for tonight.
312.512 --> 315.448  This looks like a terrible place,
but whatever.
315.448 --> 317.34999999999997  After finding
a more weatherproof base,
317.35 --> 320.586  we spent the next few hours dragging
in as many of our belongings
320.586 --> 322.422  as we could before sundown.
326.059 --> 327.56  Now, because it got dark so fast,
327.593 --> 330.129  we couldn't bring all of
our resources to the new base.
330.129 --> 331.798  So aside from one water bag,
331.798 --> 335.168  cans of chili and a couple of old
mattresses, this is all we had.
335.401 --> 337.437  What does everyone
think of our new place?
337.603 --> 339.105  I like that there's no wind.
339.205 --> 340.573  And it's much warmer.
340.673 --> 341.674  Chandler?
342.041 --> 342.742  What?
342.775 --> 345.81199999999995  It was now the third day
of seven doing this challenge.
345.812 --> 347.647  And once we got up,
we continued exploring.
347.68 --> 348.081  Be careful.
348.081 --> 349.315  These stairs actually steep.
349.615 --> 350.783  On this whole staircase,
350.783 --> 352.785  three of the stairs are normal.
352.785 --> 354.28700000000003  This beach is nice.
354.287 --> 355.488  It actually smells like a beach.
355.521 --> 357.32300000000004  It's because it is a beach.
357.724 --> 360.226  But not too far in,
something strange happened.
360.626 --> 361.69399999999996  I think I see someone.
361.728 --> 362.729  What?
362.862 --> 365.16400000000004  Don't you see that reflecting thing
over there under the stairs?
365.198 --> 365.965  Oh, I do.
366.065 --> 368.034  Jimmy, remember how we almost died
368.067 --> 369.802  the first night from glass
bottle attack?
369.802 --> 372.20500000000004  I wonder if that's
where the glass bottles came from.
372.238 --> 374.173  It was at this moment
when we realized
374.173 --> 377.377  we actually weren't alone
in this abandoned city after all.
377.41 --> 380.646  And once our cameraman spotted
this mysterious person on our drone,
380.646 --> 382.348  we did what anyone would do.
382.348 --> 383.216  Let's go check it out.
383.216 --> 384.951  Investigation.
384.984 --> 386.11899999999997  That building is sick.
386.152 --> 389.255  Why is this mansion beside
this giant motel?
389.288 --> 392.992  Decades ago, this hotel stood
as a first class vacation resort.
393.092 --> 396.12899999999996  But years of war
turn this once picturesque property
396.129 --> 397.63  into a city of ruins.
397.63 --> 398.89799999999997  Let's head on in.
399.332 --> 401.167  What did we just get ourselves into?
401.167 --> 403.102  We totally don't
wait for the cameraman
403.102 --> 404.66999999999996  to walk in the room before we go in.
405.471 --> 406.139  Anyways.
406.639 --> 407.64  It's getting dark.
407.84 --> 408.875  Everyone, stop.
408.908 --> 409.909  Stop.
409.942 --> 410.943  Candy.
411.043 --> 411.677  We should go in there.
411.711 --> 412.545  I'll go first.
412.545 --> 413.312  Go ahead.
Thank you.
413.513 --> 414.847  You think it's a Feastables bar?
414.881 --> 416.082  What the heck?
416.082 --> 418.985  This is starting to get very eerie,
and I think Mark should go first.
418.985 --> 419.986  What?
420.52 --> 422.32099999999997  Look at how deep this hallway is.
422.321 --> 424.357  Also, if you fall over here,
you might die.
424.357 --> 427.46000000000004  There's a very non-zero chance
somebody could be in here.
427.46 --> 428.861  and like attack us.
428.861 --> 430.69599999999997  If someone attacked us.
What are we doing?
430.696 --> 431.564  Every man for himself.
431.564 --> 433.199  Yeah, whoever's the slowest just dies.
433.933 --> 434.667  What's that light?
435.868 --> 437.17  Hello.
437.17 --> 439.071  I'm creeped out now, guys.
439.071 --> 441.374  We spent the rest of the day
searching for the lurk,
441.374 --> 443.009  but once it started getting dark,
443.009 --> 445.778  we can only hope that later
he wouldn't be looking for us.
445.778 --> 447.146  And now that it's dark out,
447.146 --> 448.94800000000004  here's what
we've actually been waiting for.
448.948 --> 450.049  Give me Big Bertha.
451.918 --> 452.752  Thank you.
453.553 --> 454.52  Big Bertha.
454.52 --> 456.42199999999997  Notice how you can't
see that building over there.
456.422 --> 458.658  This is the world's
most powerful flashlight.
459.492 --> 460.293  Now you can.
460.66 --> 462.66200000000003  Bro, I bet the fish
in the ocean are tripping.
464.764 --> 465.598  It stopped working.
465.598 --> 467.2  How the mighty have fallen.
468.234 --> 470.736  The pluses of our actions
is we got to play with the world's
470.77 --> 471.83799999999997  strongest flashlight at night.
471.838 --> 474.64000000000004  The negatives of our actions is that
we got to walk back in the dark.
475.141 --> 476.142  That was bad timing.
476.175 --> 478.411  It's way scarier going
through this place at night.
478.444 --> 479.712  Yeah, a thousand percent.
479.745 --> 481.347  It really
feels like the world is ending
481.347 --> 482.815  and we're just like surviving.
482.849 --> 485.051  So to avoid being murdered in cold blood,
485.051 --> 486.486  we return back the camp.
486.486 --> 487.753  We're back at camp.
487.753 --> 489.789  Yeah. I'll get a fire going.
489.822 --> 490.523  I'm hungry.
490.556 --> 492.325  There's literally only chili left.
492.325 --> 495.294  And so with the last of our supply
here, we're feasting.
495.361 --> 497.46299999999997  Tomorrow, if we got
some tables and seven chairs.
497.497 --> 498.998  - And more food.
- That'd be awesome.
499.031 --> 502.00100000000003  But when we woke up on the morning
of day four out of seven,
502.034 --> 504.57  we realized that we were already
running low on supplies.
504.57 --> 506.739  Our bag of water is out of water.
506.806 --> 507.573  Do we have more?
507.573 --> 510.176  Point the camera at that roof,
all the way over there.
510.209 --> 513.746  I wish I had more than a hundred
calories in my body to go get it.
513.779 --> 514.747  Nose goes.
515.114 --> 516.4150000000001  What does nose goes mean?
516.415 --> 517.55  It sounds like you're going.
517.583 --> 519.318  He's going to need help.
He can't carry it on his own.
519.318 --> 521.721  So Mark and Chandler
set out to go all the way back
521.721 --> 524.123  to ground Zero
to get more supplies from the crate.
524.123 --> 526.5590000000001  Chandler and I,
we're on a side quest for water.
526.592 --> 527.46  This is a main quest.
527.493 --> 528.427  While they get the water,
528.427 --> 529.529  we don't want to be useless.
529.529 --> 530.763  We? I'm fine.
530.763 --> 532.6650000000001  I don't want us to be useless.
532.698 --> 534.934  So we're going to go
try to find a table and some chairs.
535.001 --> 537.703  But we didn't get very far before
Kris got distracted,
537.803 --> 539.906  Did we not know this was here?
540.106 --> 541.107  Jimmy?
541.173 --> 543.075  - Yeah?
- I found a bike.
543.142 --> 544.744  That looks like a nice bike.
544.777 --> 546.412  - Where'd you find that?
- In here.
546.412 --> 548.414  This is the coolest abandoned city ever.
548.447 --> 550.116  - Having fun?
- I am.
550.149 --> 551.984  All right, I'm going to go
look for a table.
551.984 --> 553.1850000000001  Okay, Let's go.
553.185 --> 555.2539999999999  How are we going
to get the water out of this?
556.289 --> 557.223  It's heavy.
557.223 --> 559.959  The thought process is that
this is a house.
560.126 --> 561.5269999999999  And what do people have
in their house?
561.527 --> 562.3280000000001  Tables and chairs.
562.328 --> 563.2289999999999  Exactly.
563.262 --> 564.3969999999999  Wait, hold up.
564.397 --> 565.731  Look at this.
Don't move.
565.798 --> 566.799  Yes.
567.867 --> 569.135  Jimmy, Jimmy.
569.969 --> 570.7700000000001  it's a chair.
572.972 --> 573.9399999999999  Mark's strong.
574.04 --> 575.675  A little help here, Chan.
575.708 --> 577.6429999999999  This bag of water is over a hundred pounds.
577.71 --> 580.1120000000001  And so my buddy Mark,
being the science YouTuber that he is,
580.212 --> 582.515  had an idea to get it down
from the roof more effectively.
582.548 --> 583.549  But...
591.691 --> 593.326  Our rope broke.
593.559 --> 595.194  We need stronger rope.
595.194 --> 596.462  What you're watching is real.
596.462 --> 599.0649999999999  Mark literally deleted
half of our water.
599.065 --> 601.2  We got some bad news.
601.2 --> 602.9350000000001  Hurry up, hurry up.
603.235 --> 607.173  The rope broke and
all the water splattered on the ground.
607.173 --> 609.775  This was actually
a very serious problem.
609.842 --> 611.41  Oh, no.
611.41 --> 612.3449999999999  Are you kidding me?
612.345 --> 613.546  Mark!
613.746 --> 614.747  Sorry!
614.847 --> 617.249  Don't worry, dude,
we got one bag of water left.
617.249 --> 618.751  Carry this one down, please.
618.751 --> 621.487  And now that half of our water
is actually gone.
621.52 --> 624.6569999999999  The only possible way to complete
this seven day challenge would
624.657 --> 626.792  unfortunately,
be to send two of us home.
626.792 --> 629.128  So Kris and Chandler volunteered
to leave the city,
629.128 --> 631.5970000000001  leaving Mark and I
with just enough resources
631.631 --> 633.199  to make it the full seven days.
633.232 --> 635.8009999999999  Genuinely,
I would be scared if we left Jimmy
635.801 --> 637.0360000000001  with anybody other than you.
637.036 --> 638.838  - I think you got it.
- Oh, you guys.
638.838 --> 639.8389999999999  But before they left,
639.839 --> 642.441  we wanted to have one final feast
with the whole gang.
642.441 --> 644.543  Now that's a Feastables smores.
645.211 --> 647.0790000000001  My hair.
Yummy.
647.179 --> 649.548  Great melting point on the chocolate,
Jimmy, if I may.
649.548 --> 652.451  If you've tried Feastables before,
the ones that used to look like this,
652.485 --> 653.819  you haven't tried Feastables.
653.819 --> 655.8549999999999  Our brand new formula tastes
so much better.
655.921 --> 658.157  Genuinely go to Walmart, try Feastables
658.157 --> 659.091  and tell me what you think.
659.091 --> 663.429  It's honestly way better than the old
formula, but don't take my word for it.
663.429 --> 665.398  I just worked at NASA, so.
668.334 --> 670.703  Well, I just had s'mores
so I can go to the boat now?
670.77 --> 673.105  And so we launched a flare
to signal the boat,
673.572 --> 674.874  which was actually pretty cool.
674.874 --> 676.375  Bro, look how cool that looks.
676.575 --> 678.744  Wait, it's lighting up the entire city.
679.412 --> 682.3480000000001  But the not cool part is now
that Kris and Chandler are gone,
682.381 --> 684.55  it's just Mark
and I surviving in the city.
684.55 --> 685.751  I feel so lonely.
686.419 --> 687.987  It's our first day
without our friends.
687.987 --> 689.822  But we're going to make
the best of the situation.
689.822 --> 692.591  Our objective for today
is to renovate our shelter.
692.625 --> 694.694  We're going to put up tarps
and windproof this room.
694.727 --> 697.063  We're going to build
a fireplace in here and heat it up.
697.196 --> 698.731  We're going to find shelves and tables.
698.731 --> 700.499  We're going to make this place
looks like a home
700.499 --> 704.336  With some of the ideas we have planned
I might stick around until day 14.
704.57 --> 705.2710000000001  He's lying.
705.271 --> 707.406  And so we started exploring
some nearby buildings
707.406 --> 708.9739999999999  to find furnishing for our shelter,
708.974 --> 710.042  which is when we found this
710.042 --> 713.0450000000001  awesome shelf,
this little table, a massive carpet,
713.045 --> 715.781  and also this metal thing
that was found by our camera guy.
716.182 --> 717.083  Look at this chair.
717.083 --> 718.4169999999999  That works still, man.
718.417 --> 720.019  Bro. That's comf.
722.121 --> 723.489  I found a fake TV.
723.522 --> 725.3910000000001  We can make it
look like we have a TV now.
725.391 --> 726.2919999999999  It's a good find.
726.292 --> 728.36  Wow, that's just so cool,
728.36 --> 730.062  this like courtyard with the arches.
730.062 --> 733.265  Each building in this city
has its own personality.
733.299 --> 734.333  What can we do with these?
734.333 --> 736.168  We could use, like, a vent system
like this.
736.168 --> 738.304  Combined with these,
we can make a fireplace.
738.637 --> 740.2389999999999  Like actual wallpaper.
740.272 --> 741.373  We have wallpaper.
741.373 --> 742.341  What do we use it for?
742.341 --> 744.176  To make the house a home,
Jimmy.
744.176 --> 746.5120000000001  It's like we went grocery shopping,
but instead
746.512 --> 748.28  we grabbed a bunch of 30-year-old garbage
748.28 --> 750.116  Honey, we're home.
750.116 --> 751.584  We found all this stuff.
751.584 --> 753.0179999999999  Now we're going to start decorating.
753.018 --> 755.821  We're no longer surviving,
Jimmy. We're thriving.
755.855 --> 756.422  I like that.
756.422 --> 758.357  We literally spent the next 4 hours
758.357 --> 760.126  moving all the rubble
out of our shelter,
760.126 --> 761.36  which made us pretty thirsty.
761.36 --> 763.529  The water in these sacks
tastes like trash,
763.529 --> 765.364  which is why we all
brought a Cirkul water bottle,
765.364 --> 767.032  because you can put a flavor
cartridge in it
767.032 --> 768.2  and make water taste good.
768.2 --> 770.269  This is my first time
drinking a Cirkul bottle.
770.269 --> 771.704  Delightful experience.
771.704 --> 773.1389999999999  You can determine the intensity.
773.139 --> 776.609  So if you're feeling really audacious,
you can have level nine flavor.
776.642 --> 778.711  Or if you're just a wuss,
you can have a level one flavor.
778.744 --> 779.4780000000001  I’m trying six.
779.678 --> 781.147  Six. I'll match your six.
781.18 --> 782.8149999999999  That tastes awesome.
782.815 --> 784.216  Which flavor are you using?
784.216 --> 786.452  I'm rocking fruit punch
because it's got energy.
786.452 --> 788.053  And you know what we need right now,
Jimmy?
788.154 --> 788.888  Energy.
788.921 --> 790.8900000000001  - That's right
- Good thing Cirkul has our back.
790.89 --> 792.2909999999999  And now that we had been hydrated,
792.291 --> 794.5600000000001  it was time to start crushing
these renovations.
794.56 --> 795.9609999999999  When everything's said and done,
795.961 --> 799.298  this room will be the greatest room in
an abandoned city you've ever seen.
799.331 --> 800.432  This is our new shelf.
800.432 --> 801.8340000000001  All right, let's see how she looks.
801.867 --> 803.035  See that?
See all that dust?
803.602 --> 805.204  Oh, isn't that satisfying?
805.204 --> 807.7399999999999  And now that the shelf is clean,
we can use it to store food.
807.74 --> 810.242  For some reason, over half
the food we packed is chili.
810.242 --> 811.911  And no one here likes chili.
811.944 --> 813.112  That's the non chili row.
813.145 --> 814.146  That's the chili row.
814.146 --> 816.2149999999999  This is the Feastables row right there.
816.315 --> 818.984  Now we have a table
to put our Cirkul water bottles.
819.018 --> 821.754  Mark has a 22 ounce bottle.
This is the 32 ounce bottle.
821.854 --> 823.889  And they have a metal double
insulated bottle
823.889 --> 826.792  that you can get for free right now
if you buy ten flavor cartridges.
826.792 --> 827.5600000000001  What a steal.
827.593 --> 828.794  It's not a steal.
It's free.
830.863 --> 832.0310000000001  All right.
832.064 --> 833.632  That's going to block a lot of wind.
833.666 --> 834.9670000000001  With our new door in place,
835.0 --> 836.836  we also hung up this huge tarp,
836.836 --> 838.47  which will allow us
to keep all the heat
838.47 --> 840.4060000000001  from the fireplace inside our shelter.
840.439 --> 841.507  Oxygen comes in,
841.54 --> 844.6429999999999  fire burns, sends heat in the room,
send smoke out.
844.677 --> 846.946  This is redneck
engineering at its finest.
846.946 --> 849.215  Finally,
after being cold for so long.
849.248 --> 850.783  - All right.
- Look at that.
850.816 --> 852.318  And we have a fire.
852.418 --> 853.652  I can feel the heat coming out.
853.652 --> 857.289  Wait, Jimmy rigged this up
in like ruins from an abandoned city.
857.323 --> 859.592  Anyway, go to DrinkCirkul.com/MrBeast...
859.592 --> 863.162  Or scan the QR code on his face,
if you want to order a Cirkul right now.
863.195 --> 865.865  This is the final room.
We have plenty in the corner.
865.865 --> 867.967  We have our beds
that are now smaller.
868.0 --> 869.335  Tell me this isn't genius.
869.335 --> 872.004  This is Mark's iPad in the TV frame.
872.004 --> 874.306  Obviously some nice lighting,
a furnace
874.306 --> 877.142  that is heating up the room,
a real table with chairs
877.409 --> 880.512  and a shelving unit
with the scraps of food we have left
880.546 --> 882.3140000000001  and a dirty towel
we've been sharing.
882.381 --> 883.949  This is survival.
883.949 --> 887.353  But just as our night was going so
well for the fifth day in a row,
888.454 --> 889.7879999999999  we heard a broken glass.
889.788 --> 891.523  - Mark.
- I'm right here, dog.
891.557 --> 892.491  What was that?
892.524 --> 894.994  Man, we were having such a good day too.
895.027 --> 896.462  I want to go see who's upstairs.
896.462 --> 899.298  I'm carrying the knife as a threat,
but I'm not going to use it.
899.298 --> 901.567  Hey, if you're up here,
just come out.
901.767 --> 903.369  I want to be best friends with you.
903.369 --> 905.1700000000001  Are you serious, you're not pranking me?
905.204 --> 907.606  Bro, I swear to you it was not me.
907.606 --> 909.141  Hello.
909.608 --> 911.2099999999999  What is this?
911.243 --> 912.4110000000001  Bro!
Oh, my God.
912.444 --> 914.947  This is the most Mark Rober thing
I've ever seen.
916.782 --> 919.318  What the heck? You swore!
919.351 --> 921.453  Yeah, so turns out Mark was pranking us,
921.453 --> 923.622  and he was the one dropping
these bottles the whole time.
923.622 --> 925.991  I've got a remote control here.
But no one suspects it.
925.991 --> 927.559  I can be in my sleeping bag
927.559 --> 929.762  and I can start launching glass
bottles through the roof.
929.762 --> 930.7629999999999  Freak everyone out.
930.763 --> 932.0310000000001  Oh, my gosh.
932.031 --> 933.799  I thought I could trust you.
935.1 --> 938.27  Now that Mark's not pranking me,
we re-rigged his contraption.
938.304 --> 939.438  Feastables me.
941.006 --> 941.807  There you go.
941.807 --> 943.309  I'll take one.
943.776 --> 944.977  I got one as well.
945.01 --> 947.146  That's kind of cool.
947.88 --> 949.8149999999999  To be honest, it was pretty easy
to forgive Mark
949.848 --> 952.685  because we only had one day left
in this challenge.
952.685 --> 954.1859999999999  Good morning.
954.219 --> 957.1890000000001  Good morning abandoned city.
957.189 --> 960.3589999999999  Abandoned city, abandoned city.
960.392 --> 962.3280000000001  It's so much colder out here
than it is in there.
963.295 --> 964.563  Let's go back.
964.563 --> 966.098  It's now the morning of day six.
966.098 --> 968.7009999999999  All the modifications
we did were phenomenal
968.701 --> 970.5020000000001  and it was at least ten degrees
warmer.
970.502 --> 972.5709999999999  - That was amazing.
- Slept incredible.
972.638 --> 975.7080000000001  Mark, on our last real day,
I say we go have some fun.
979.044 --> 980.913  - Yeah!
- Yeah!
980.913 --> 981.981  Jimmy, is that a kayak?
982.348 --> 983.8159999999999  I know what we should do with it.
986.151 --> 987.853  Now someone can kayak in this pool.
987.886 --> 989.621  Me and Mark really did have a lot of fun.
989.621 --> 991.6569999999999  Played baseball, played soccer.
991.657 --> 994.46  Mark even taught me how to skip
rocks scientifically.
994.526 --> 995.294  There it is.
995.294 --> 998.097  And even screaming at each other
from different sides of the city.
998.13 --> 999.698  - Mark!
- What!
999.732 --> 1003.168  Let's throw things off the roof
at the same time!
1003.202 --> 1004.837  Great idea!
1004.87 --> 1007.339  To be honest,
doing all these kind of dumb things
1007.506 --> 1010.709  really did take our minds off
of how lonely this city really was.
1010.776 --> 1012.678  Yeah!
1013.479 --> 1015.8480000000001  And by the time
the final day of this challenge arrived
1015.881 --> 1018.65  after cleaning up camp,
we only had one objective in mind.
1019.752 --> 1022.4879999999999  Leaving this
place and never coming back.
1023.655 --> 1024.99  I’m here!
1025.057 --> 1026.792  - I’m here!
- Freedom!
1027.059 --> 1029.4279999999999  Huge shout out to Mark. 
He didn't have to do this. 
1029.428 --> 1031.1960000000001  He has his own channel is very busy.
1031.33 --> 1033.532  Here's the channel.
I appreciate you.
1033.532 --> 1034.233  And let's get out of here.
1034.233 --> 1035.134  Let's go.
1035.234 --> 1037.703  By the way,
I'm giving away $10,000 a day
1037.703 --> 1040.239  for the next 20 days to people who
buy Feastables.
1040.372 --> 1042.141  Go buy the new formula, it tastes amazing.
