0.96 --> 6.439  ladies and gentlemen welcome back to the
3.56 --> 10.599  candidates Tournament of
6.439 --> 13.679  2024 this is a double round robin eight
10.599 --> 16.44  player event and the winner will play
13.679 --> 18.4  for the World Chess Championship we have
16.44 --> 19.92  the open candidates and the women's
18.4 --> 21.759999999999998  candidates happening at the exact same
19.92 --> 24.48  time for the first time in history and
21.76 --> 26.64  this is round number two out of 14 today
24.48 --> 28.76  there was an earthquake in New York City
26.64 --> 31.039  luckily it was not that big but still it
28.76 --> 33.32  shook the house multiple times
31.039 --> 36.84  and today there was an earthquake in
33.32 --> 39.16  Toronto both literally maybe I don't
36.84 --> 40.64  know but also metaphorically because
39.16 --> 42.879  today's games were absolutely
40.64 --> 45.039  unbelievable and I am going to take you
42.879 --> 49.599999999999994  through every single one of them as I
45.039 --> 51.760000000000005  always do and uh today vidit gti's name
49.6 --> 54.559  is so long it actually goes off the
51.76 --> 56.199  screen that is a first uh and that's
54.559 --> 58.038999999999994  because I added the scores that is
56.199 --> 59.48  generally not part of their name and I
58.039 --> 63.760000000000005  am showing you that they both have half
59.48 --> 65.15899999999999  out of one point all right here we go
63.76 --> 67.96  friendly reminder for the next couple of
65.159 --> 70.32000000000001  days all my courses 33% off just to
67.96 --> 73.0  begin the candidates hikaro opens with
70.32 --> 74.75899999999999  E4 we have hikaro versus vided GTI in
73.0 --> 76.04  the first game and then I will show you
74.759 --> 79.28  all the other games because they were
76.04 --> 83.72  all very very fun this one a Spanish all
79.28 --> 87.119  right and vided gate here does not play
83.72 --> 88.0  the main line with A6 Knight F6 he plays
87.119 --> 91.64  the
88.0 --> 93.96  Berlin excuse me this open opening was
91.64 --> 95.479  uh popularized in the year 2000 by
93.96 --> 96.96  Vladimir krck in a world championship
95.479 --> 99.03999999999999  match against Gary Kasparov and this is
96.96 --> 100.91999999999999  kind of the antidote to the Spanish
99.04 --> 102.72000000000001  which is why Karo plays D3 this is very
100.92 --> 103.84  trendy nowadays you do not allow the
102.72 --> 105.52  Knight to take but this is a very
103.84 --> 106.71900000000001  committal decision I'm not going to bore
105.52 --> 108.92  you with all the intricacies and the
106.719 --> 111.399  details but the Berlin was supposed to
108.92 --> 113.2  be the antidote to the Spanish the anti-
111.399 --> 115.28  Berlin which doesn't allow black to take
113.2 --> 118.28  this Pawn uh is the antidote to the
115.28 --> 119.56  Berlin Bishop C5 now hikaro plays C3
118.28 --> 121.68  controlling the center and preparing
119.56 --> 122.88  this move move both sides Castle vidit
121.68 --> 124.24000000000001  puts the pawn in the center because
122.88 --> 125.56  that's what you're supposed to do we're
124.24 --> 127.32  going to see another game a little bit
125.56 --> 128.75900000000001  later where black plays this move D5
127.32 --> 130.119  which is a slightly more aggressive way
128.759 --> 131.79999999999998  of playing this opening and kind of
130.119 --> 133.64  shows you the way chz branches out into
131.8 --> 137.72  multiple variations as the game
133.64 --> 140.16  progresses D6 H3 and at this point vidit
137.72 --> 141.48  resends the offer of allowing the Knight
140.16 --> 143.68  to be captured and says you know what
141.48 --> 146.35999999999999  Hikaru you waited long enough now this
143.68 --> 148.16  bishop will be a target for my pawns and
146.36 --> 150.12  then I'll put the Knight right here all
148.16 --> 151.64  of this has been played before which is
150.12 --> 154.0  why hikaro in this position played the
151.64 --> 155.92  move Pawn to D4 a very natural move if
154.0 --> 158.239  black takes white gets a very healthy
155.92 --> 159.72  Center and a very comfortable Advantage
158.239 --> 161.59900000000002  the move d4 has been played some
159.72 --> 164.35999999999999  hundreds of times and black here
161.599 --> 166.0  frequently will choose between taking uh
164.36 --> 168.31900000000002  but generally retreating the bishop back
166.0 --> 170.519  to the B6
168.319 --> 172.28  Square which is why it must have been
170.519 --> 175.84  extremely
172.28 --> 178.84  surprising when vidit went
175.84 --> 181.519  here which is
178.84 --> 184.84  literally a
181.519 --> 188.12  move that has never been played
184.84 --> 190.599  before this is what we call a novelty it
188.12 --> 192.08  is a move that has liter I mean it might
190.599 --> 194.72  have been played in like random games at
192.08 --> 196.519  bars but it literally has never been
194.72 --> 201.4  played before
196.519 --> 204.519  ever ever and the idea of this
201.4 --> 206.44  move is that if white takes and black
204.519 --> 208.84  takes and white and white takes another
206.44 --> 211.159  Pawn black will simply put the knights
208.84 --> 213.56  like this and then put the bishop like
211.159 --> 215.599  this and this Pawn it's kind of a
213.56 --> 217.239  liability for white white can't move the
215.599 --> 219.0  Knight out white struggles to move the
217.239 --> 220.59900000000002  bishop because of this and in the future
219.0 --> 222.439  black will plant the Knight here and
220.599 --> 226.439  attack it's actually kind of a brilliant
222.439 --> 228.76  little move so Hikaru thinks and plays
226.439 --> 231.519  Bishop D3 spends seven minutes and vidit
228.76 --> 234.28  also doesn't take he loses a pawn in the
231.519 --> 237.159  center what on Earth is vidit doing Karu
234.28 --> 238.879  takes 25 another 20 minutes down the
237.159 --> 241.439  drain not down the drain he's thinking
238.879 --> 243.92  but that's a massive time investment he
241.439 --> 246.64  takes and he grabs the pawn on E5 he
243.92 --> 250.79899999999998  doesn't understand what is vid's idea
246.64 --> 253.319  and vidit in this position uncorks the
250.799 --> 255.16  hay maker Bishop
253.319 --> 257.88  takes
255.16 --> 261.04  what did he just completely lost the
257.88 --> 264.15999999999997  bishop this was part of his preparation
261.04 --> 267.84000000000003  Hikaru now thinks and plays Knight C4
264.16 --> 272.16  now the idea of this is that if white
267.84 --> 275.84  takes black plays quick Queen B8 and
272.16 --> 275.84000000000003  somehow is doing
276.6 --> 280.84000000000003  fine
279.0 --> 283.12  I
280.84 --> 286.08  what what is
283.12 --> 288.479  happening white can now play Bishop F4
286.08 --> 289.96  Bishop C7 bring the bishop back allow
288.479 --> 291.44  this to get captured and go here and
289.96 --> 293.75899999999996  that is probably what hikaro should have
291.44 --> 295.52  gone for something like this but this is
293.759 --> 297.44  still a very very very dangerous
295.52 --> 299.79999999999995  position so instead of that hikaro plays
297.44 --> 302.12  Knight C4 and he's emerged from the
299.8 --> 304.32  opening down 40 minutes on the clock
302.12 --> 307.919  this is an unbelievable demonstration of
304.32 --> 310.68  preparation by team vided Bishop G4 and
307.919 --> 312.75899999999996  now vidid is on his own so he plays
310.68 --> 315.96  Bishop C7 you'll notice he spent 30
312.759 --> 318.6  minutes generally that is a bad sign and
315.96 --> 322.0  now Karu is probably back in the game
318.6 --> 323.759  Hikaru finds this idea E5 right the best
322.0 --> 325.96  move here for black was to play Knight
323.759 --> 327.639  G6 not worried that this bishop will get
325.96 --> 329.15999999999997  taken because you have a lot of activity
327.639 --> 330.199  and black is slightly better because of
329.16 --> 332.44  all the prepar
330.199 --> 334.72  but Bishop C7 is what he played and now
332.44 --> 336.24  Karu grabs himself a Pawn on H7 and
334.72 --> 338.24  forces vid to move and he's caught up on
336.24 --> 340.36  time this is really bad for vidit really
338.24 --> 342.72  really bad and now the best move for
340.36 --> 345.68  white is to play Queen E4 and start
342.72 --> 347.88000000000005  fighting back black could play F5 white
345.68 --> 349.319  would play Bishop takes F5 you can't
347.88 --> 352.88  take with anything or else Queen takes
349.319 --> 354.759  here so check on H4 Bishop G5 I mean
352.88 --> 357.84  this is almost impossible to generally
354.759 --> 360.96000000000004  play and maybe white will liquidate
357.84 --> 363.52  things and potentially get out of uh
360.96 --> 365.0  but Hikaru comes back with the bishop so
363.52 --> 366.56  you'll notice he spent another 20
365.0 --> 368.56  minutes and I I think it was just a
366.56 --> 370.4  level of hesitation here because now
368.56 --> 372.36  vidit immediately pounces on the
370.4 --> 374.23999999999995  initiative again and he's removing
372.36 --> 377.639  hikaru's control of the center Hikaru
374.24 --> 380.759  comes back vidit takes and Karu must
377.639 --> 382.24  have felt like he needs to he needs to
380.759 --> 384.56  do something like right now like he's
382.24 --> 387.479  got to fight back so he played this move
384.56 --> 389.12  quite quickly he didn't take the Knight
387.479 --> 390.199  which is actually the best move taking
389.12 --> 392.08  he didn't take the Bishop which is the
390.199 --> 393.91900000000004  best move after which he would have had
392.08 --> 396.19899999999996  to suffer a little bit like he would
393.919 --> 398.599  have been in a in in a worse position
396.199 --> 401.039  but it would have been balanced like
398.599 --> 404.15999999999997  worse but maybe manageable in the long
401.039 --> 407.36  run instead he Retreats offering a trade
404.16 --> 410.47900000000004  and videt goes here and he is completely
407.36 --> 412.47900000000004  winning like just a moment of like
410.479 --> 414.52  autopilot just a bit you know Karo just
412.479 --> 418.15999999999997  kind of retreated thought I'm not gonna
414.52 --> 422.87899999999996  trade let me go back F5 and Bishop
418.16 --> 426.24  B6 and it's over white is under
422.879 --> 428.84000000000003  unbelievable pressure vidit flies in
426.24 --> 431.68  with the Knights puts the king to safety
428.84 --> 433.79999999999995  sacrifices a knight Queen goes to G5
431.68 --> 436.52  gets the Knight back with interest rips
433.8 --> 438.879  open the white position and white has
436.52 --> 442.71999999999997  three pieces on their home squares Rook
438.879 --> 445.36  d8 King C1 Knight F1 discovered check
442.72 --> 448.52000000000004  and in this position Kikar resigns 29
445.36 --> 451.40000000000003  moves 29 moves but it was
448.52 --> 453.96  winning from move 18 officially but it
451.4 --> 456.15999999999997  was like the the preparation Bishop H3
453.96 --> 457.79999999999995  was ridiculous if Hikaru had found all
456.16 --> 459.84000000000003  the moves he would have escape the
457.8 --> 461.68  opening and he would have been okay but
459.84 --> 464.67999999999995  he goes down with the white pieces to
461.68 --> 467.44  vid GTI who is the first man to win in
464.68 --> 469.08  the candidates this year they drew all
467.44 --> 472.08  their games yesterday but they were 10
469.08 --> 473.639  games unbelievable result from vidit and
472.08 --> 475.87899999999996  uh it's too early in the tournament to
473.639 --> 477.56  start fixing the narratives but I I I
475.879 --> 479.28000000000003  thought before the event that of all the
477.56 --> 481.36  three Indians playing Prague probably
479.28 --> 482.4  had the best shot well Brock played gkes
481.36 --> 484.56  in this round which we're going to look
482.4 --> 486.84  at later so crazy stuff great win for
484.56 --> 488.08  vidit hikaro the good thing for hikaro
486.84 --> 489.84  is he's going to have to kind of throw
488.08 --> 492.039  this game in the garbage and if you're a
489.84 --> 494.0  Hikaru fan this is actually kind of the
492.039 --> 496.08  best way to lose because it was a little
494.0 --> 497.759  bit of a of a you know of like a fire
496.08 --> 500.68  like a flame and you throw it in the
497.759 --> 502.759  garbage and you just rely on Preparation
500.68 --> 506.639  and uh and and form for the rest of the
502.759 --> 509.199  event but but but this this is this is
506.639 --> 511.40000000000003  hardly the only exciting game we have an
509.199 --> 512.919  all Indian teenager matchup two of the
511.4 --> 515.8389999999999  youngest participants of the candidates
512.919 --> 518.519  tournament ever number 14 and number 16
515.839 --> 519.8000000000001  on planet Earth like five rating points
518.519 --> 523.32  away each from being the number one
519.8 --> 525.92  ranked Indian in the world this is
523.32 --> 528.519  legendary stuff th th this is like if we
525.92 --> 530.36  got the this this is like alcaras Center
528.519 --> 534.24  okay like this is the modern day young
530.36 --> 537.36  rivalry D4 D5 and it is a Catalan with
534.24 --> 540.6800000000001  Bishop to B4 check all right Bishop G2
537.36 --> 543.9590000000001  is coming from Prague but Prague plays a
540.68 --> 545.88  sideline he gives up the pawn on C4 and
543.959 --> 549.0  this line is one where white wants a big
545.88 --> 551.92  Center and wants the bishop on G2 but
549.0 --> 555.12  he's ready to lose a pawn so he goes
551.92 --> 556.88  here we have Knight C6 this move putting
555.12 --> 559.48  pressure on the White Center disallowing
556.88 --> 562.399  this knight from Easy maneuvering kicks
559.48 --> 564.5600000000001  out the bishop takes the center and says
562.399 --> 566.68  hey kukesh you got to defend your Pawn
564.56 --> 570.1199999999999  which he does A6 but gkes is out of his
566.68 --> 572.8  prep 10 minutes spent all right Bishop 2
570.12 --> 575.9590000000001  E3
572.8 --> 578.0  B5 you don't play like this with white
575.959 --> 581.079  if you are trying to be solid you don't
578.0 --> 583.6  do it black now just has a clean extra
581.079 --> 587.12  Pawn but white has a big Center White
583.6 --> 589.72  has more space and white puts the pieces
587.12 --> 593.76  like this and with his 40-minute time
589.72 --> 597.88  Advantage walks directly into the gcash
593.76 --> 602.519  position gukesh captures on D5 and
597.88 --> 606.8389999999999  Prague goes for for again Prague goes
602.519 --> 612.8  forward again gukesh goes back to E8
606.839 --> 615.36  44 minute time Advantage from Prague but
612.8 --> 618.8389999999999  he is down two pawns and if you thought
615.36 --> 621.0790000000001  two pawns was enough he sacrifices a
618.839 --> 622.6  third
621.079 --> 625.92  East
622.6 --> 627.6  what so ridiculous he straight up gave
625.92 --> 629.92  him three
627.6 --> 634.0  pawns he gave him three Pawns
629.92 --> 635.56  pawns and his idea is to go Knight D4
634.0 --> 639.12  and just start winning the back one by
635.56 --> 640.4399999999999  one Queen here Bishop F4 this this
639.12 --> 642.6  everything in the black Position will
640.44 --> 646.5600000000001  collapse this is crazy which is why gesh
642.6 --> 649.639  thought and went F5 gesh spent another
646.56 --> 651.68  27 minutes on this move if you talk
649.639 --> 653.48  about a psychological advantage I have
651.68 --> 655.68  never seen one like this before
653.48 --> 658.6800000000001  70-minute time Advantage from The Golden
655.68 --> 660.2399999999999  Boy I'm talking about Prague like with
658.68 --> 662.519  all the coverage and everything like the
660.24 --> 665.24  the the beating Magnus I mean these
662.519 --> 666.5600000000001  Indian teenagers are rock stars and
665.24 --> 668.6800000000001  Prague right now has the upper hand on
666.56 --> 671.079  gesh he has spent no time in this
668.68 --> 672.88  opening and he continues to spend no
671.079 --> 674.519  time KES has to play a little bit faster
672.88 --> 676.399  so he puts the Knight on F6 and he's
674.519 --> 678.0  defending himself with his pieces Prague
676.399 --> 679.68  is a pawn two squares away from queening
678.0 --> 682.12  a massive thorman in the white position
679.68 --> 684.8  he plays Queen C2 finally Prague thinks
682.12 --> 687.639  for 40 minutes out of prep on his own he
684.8 --> 689.8  spends 40 minutes thinking and gukesh
687.639 --> 692.12  plays C6 and just says you know what
689.8 --> 694.639  I have this Rock Solid formation prag
692.12 --> 696.44  can take one of his pawns back but now
694.639 --> 699.399  I'm going to I'm going to defend look at
696.44 --> 703.8000000000001  this position brick wall absolute unit
699.399 --> 704.839  of a wall Queen E8 brog plays Knight F7
703.8 --> 707.639  Bishop
704.839 --> 710.519  C8 this type of Defense eighth rank
707.639 --> 711.839  defense defending your opponents roaring
710.519 --> 715.0  initiative coming down to your side of
711.839 --> 716.48  the board this is called kovan playing
715.0 --> 719.079  like anat carpov one of the world
716.48 --> 721.5600000000001  champions five out of his eight pieces
719.079 --> 724.0  are are on the back rank Prague is there
721.56 --> 725.8  he is on the one ydd line to make an NFL
724.0 --> 729.279  reference but he can't score the
725.8 --> 730.7199999999999  touchdown yet Rook E1 Knight B7 now the
729.279 --> 732.04  Knight is venturing away it doesn't even
730.72 --> 734.5600000000001  want to come here it wants to come here
732.04 --> 736.76  or here or maybe here and here so what
734.56 --> 738.3199999999999  is the game plan Bishop G5 I mean Prague
736.76 --> 740.3199999999999  you if you're if you're Prague in this
738.32 --> 741.88  position you literally cannot have more
740.32 --> 744.1990000000001  pressure on your opponent but now you
741.88 --> 746.079  have to do something now you have to do
744.199 --> 748.079  something now you have to make it count
746.079 --> 751.04  so he begins making it count by taking
748.079 --> 753.88  on F6 and sacrificing the bishop oh my
751.04 --> 756.4399999999999  goodness this is poker this is like a
753.88 --> 757.68  mix of Poker and chess he he is all in
756.44 --> 759.839  all the chips are in the center of the
757.68 --> 761.399  table he gives away the bishop he takes
759.839 --> 764.1990000000001  like this and if you count the material
761.399 --> 766.8  right now prag is down a piece for a
764.199 --> 769.639  pawn and there are threats all over the
766.8 --> 773.3599999999999  place Knight C7 E7 Knight to D6
769.639 --> 776.44  everything is spinning ukes best move
773.36 --> 779.1990000000001  slides back one
776.44 --> 781.839  square Prague in this position now has
779.199 --> 785.24  to give up a knight that's the only move
781.839 --> 787.72  apparently Queen G4 check and the idea
785.24 --> 789.36  is Queen D4 sniping The Rook on the
787.72 --> 793.0400000000001  other side of the board but instead he
789.36 --> 795.44  goes here trying to set it up and Knight
793.04 --> 798.36  d8 and all of a
795.44 --> 800.6800000000001  sudden five of his seven pieces are on
798.36 --> 802.9590000000001  the eighth rank seven out of his seven
800.68 --> 806.8  pieces are on the last two
802.959 --> 811.1199999999999  ranks but when the dust is
806.8 --> 811.12  settling Prague has nothing
811.48 --> 816.44  Prague has absolutely nothing left five
814.519 --> 819.279  out of six pieces now on the back
816.44 --> 821.9200000000001  rank but there's nothing Queen D4 The
819.279 --> 823.56  Rook slides over a square Prague tries
821.92 --> 826.4399999999999  to continue to make something happen but
823.56 --> 829.959  he's being pushed back and gukesh in
826.44 --> 833.0  this position lands one strike and the
829.959 --> 838.04  strike that he lands is
833.0 --> 839.56  Rook that was a bishop move Rook takes
838.04 --> 840.92  F2
839.56 --> 844.3199999999999  like
840.92 --> 846.4799999999999  this and Prague resigns and gukesh
844.32 --> 848.9200000000001  defeats Prague after one of the most
846.48 --> 851.6800000000001  absurd defensive games I've ever seen
848.92 --> 853.959  the bishop went to B4 but if we if we
851.68 --> 856.7589999999999  exclude that move for a second cuz the
853.959 --> 859.4799999999999  bishop went back look at how little
856.759 --> 860.279  moves black made on his opponent's side
859.48 --> 864.0  of the
860.279 --> 866.759  board look look look how few Mo black
864.0 --> 869.279  made nearly no moves in White's
866.759 --> 872.6800000000001  territory past the opening I understand
869.279 --> 875.4399999999999  upon there that was early look at this
872.68 --> 878.04  this was a master class in dealing with
875.44 --> 880.2790000000001  your opponent's momentum look at this he
878.04 --> 882.8  did nothing he literally just removed
880.279 --> 886.0  the pieces and then made one move into
882.8 --> 889.199  his opponent's territory Rook F2
886.0 --> 891.68  unbelievable defensive game from GES
889.199 --> 896.4799999999999  Sublime Sublime game he has one and a
891.68 --> 897.519  half he wins as well vidit and gukesh
896.48 --> 899.639  the early
897.519 --> 901.12  winners of the day I mean just
899.639 --> 904.399  incredible stuff let's pop over to the
901.12 --> 907.36  women's side of things nul salimova I am
904.399 --> 909.0  from Bulgaria leting the only person
907.36 --> 910.04  that lost in the first round seven draws
909.0 --> 911.16  and she was the only person that lost
910.04 --> 913.079  she's the former Challenger for the
911.16 --> 914.56  World Chess Championship uh on the
913.079 --> 917.5999999999999  women's side this one a Queens Gambit
914.56 --> 920.0  accepted Knight F3 Knight F6 captures on
917.6 --> 921.72  C4 this is a main line and we get a
920.0 --> 923.959  queenless middle game early I have a
921.72 --> 926.6  feeling Lings yet kind of wanted
923.959 --> 928.5189999999999  stability and in this type of game it is
926.6 --> 931.36  white that has to put the pressure the
928.519 --> 933.279  players kind of get intermixed uh and
931.36 --> 935.0790000000001  white tries you can take the Rook but
933.279 --> 937.0  then the other Rook is hanging uh but
935.079 --> 938.88  nothing really happens in this one pie
937.0 --> 939.92  slowly come off the board black has a
938.88 --> 941.8389999999999  little bit of pressure but those
939.92 --> 943.319  queenside pawns are going to trade off
941.839 --> 945.12  and not a whole lot is going to happen
943.319 --> 948.079  here as we go to a rook and three versus
945.12 --> 950.24  Rook on 3 endgame we have a repetition
948.079 --> 953.959  nurul salimova two draws to start versus
950.24 --> 957.12  Anam musuk and leting not so bad Leia is
953.959 --> 959.88  on the board now another game Katarina
957.12 --> 962.399  lagno versus humpy Connor both Drew in
959.88 --> 963.639  the first game both are also uh Legends
962.399 --> 966.519  I mean absolute Legends by the way we
963.639 --> 968.6800000000001  see A6 not a Berlin which is what vidit
966.519 --> 970.759  played this is a main line and now white
968.68 --> 973.8  plays this D3 setup which is a slight
970.759 --> 976.6  sideline and A4 we have Pawn takes Pawn
973.8 --> 978.16  takes a trade and now black takes on A3
976.6 --> 979.9200000000001  it's a big decision giving up the bishop
978.16 --> 981.92  for the knights white gets the bishop
979.92 --> 984.7199999999999  pair but black very active in the center
981.92 --> 988.04  of the board Knight to D4 what an idea
984.72 --> 989.639  and here humpy uh with this move Knight
988.04 --> 991.639  D4 playing quite aggressively but
989.639 --> 994.399  instead of taking Katrina can consider
991.639 --> 996.9590000000001  this move C4 holding together the center
994.399 --> 999.079  instead of that which looked quite
996.959 --> 1000.7589999999999  promising she could have claimed some
999.079 --> 1003.279  degree of an advantage but black would
1000.759 --> 1004.92  have obviously had some uh compensation
1003.279 --> 1007.199  uh instead we have a knight trade in the
1004.92 --> 1010.319  center of the board and quite quickly
1007.199 --> 1011.4799999999999  literally all the pieces fall off and
1010.319 --> 1012.759  now it's a queen end game and if
1011.48 --> 1014.839  anybody's going to win this it's white
1012.759 --> 1018.16  because of the slightly bad structure
1014.839 --> 1020.0790000000001  but uh and and the outside pass Pawn uh
1018.16 --> 1022.399  and actually white does get some pretty
1020.079 --> 1025.0  decent chances but humpy was very
1022.399 --> 1027.559  accurate with her defense and uh the
1025.0 --> 1030.0  players end up making a draw and guess
1027.559 --> 1032.48  what that was the last draw of the
1030.0 --> 1035.919  round yep the rest of the game somebody
1032.48 --> 1038.559  lost we had one out of eight decisive
1035.919 --> 1041.16  results and today we had six so we get
1038.559 --> 1043.559  the draws out of the
1041.16 --> 1046.799  way the rest of the game somebody won
1043.559 --> 1049.799  somebody lost all right Yan pishi Ali
1046.799 --> 1052.0  Resa Fuji Yan pishi back to back World
1049.799 --> 1054.48  chess champion Challenger okay backto
1052.0 --> 1056.679  back winner of the candidates aliv Resa
1054.48 --> 1058.64  fuja youngest ever player to cross 2800
1056.679 --> 1060.919  massive expectations on him I mean
1058.64 --> 1065.0800000000002  really I cannot understate absolutely
1060.919 --> 1068.72  massive absolutely massive E4 E5 a
1065.08 --> 1070.76  Spanish a Berlin No Berlin and remember
1068.72 --> 1074.52  how in the first game of the day I told
1070.76 --> 1078.08  you that there was uh castles D6 well in
1074.52 --> 1080.12  this game we have castles and D5 Yan
1078.08 --> 1081.76  captures on D5 5 the queen comes out and
1080.12 --> 1083.2399999999998  this allows white to kind of take some
1081.76 --> 1085.559  space on the queen side because that is
1083.24 --> 1088.2  exactly what black is offering Knight D2
1085.559 --> 1089.72  and A4 this has been played many times
1088.2 --> 1092.32  this type of position where white tries
1089.72 --> 1094.159  to expand over there black gets active
1092.32 --> 1097.039  white defends on C2 and now we've sort
1094.159 --> 1099.2  of left the known Theory Bishop to G4 we
1097.039 --> 1100.96  see Ali Resa in his preparation Queen A2
1099.2 --> 1103.6000000000001  from Yan both guys know what they're
1100.96 --> 1106.6000000000001  doing both guys have studied this bishop
1103.6 --> 1109.4399999999998  F3 gf3 Queen takes
1106.6 --> 1111.8799999999999  D3 taking the Free Pawn white defends
1109.44 --> 1113.4  the free uh the other pawn and queen D7
1111.88 --> 1115.72  so Ali Resa at this point out of his
1113.4 --> 1118.799  prep probably spends 6 minutes comes
1115.72 --> 1121.64  back Yan is uh down a
1118.799 --> 1124.36  pawn however this type of approach by
1121.64 --> 1126.039  white all right giving up the king
1124.36 --> 1128.32  safety and giving up a pawn he gives up
1126.039 --> 1130.28  the king and he gives up the pawn but
1128.32 --> 1132.96  what does he get in return what he gets
1130.28 --> 1136.0  in return is active
1132.96 --> 1139.72  Rooks Queen goes to
1136.0 --> 1143.039  E8 and an attack
1139.72 --> 1144.76  this is a freaking creative way to play
1143.039 --> 1148.0  chess
1144.76 --> 1151.52  H4 and Jan is basically saying you can't
1148.0 --> 1153.32  cross the middle the defile is lava you
1151.52 --> 1154.6  can't play F5 which is why Ali Resa
1153.32 --> 1157.6399999999999  brings the Knight back and then plays
1154.6 --> 1161.84  King h8 look at yan pomi yan pomi middle
1157.64 --> 1165.3600000000001  of the game my man just went H4 H5
1161.84 --> 1167.76  H6 dude just straight up sent the pawn
1165.36 --> 1168.8799999999999  in like he didn't touch anything else
1167.76 --> 1170.679  everything else was beautiful it was
1168.88 --> 1174.2800000000002  like a painting he didn't touch anything
1170.679 --> 1175.88  else Ali Resa now plays G5 because you
1174.28 --> 1178.44  can't take because the G file would be
1175.88 --> 1180.3200000000002  open the queen goes to attack the pawn
1178.44 --> 1183.3200000000002  the Knight jumps into to D6 to trade
1180.32 --> 1185.6  away the Knight Bishop B2 now the engine
1183.32 --> 1188.48  here is giving black an edge Ali Resa
1185.6 --> 1190.36  has an advantage and he plays Knight F5
1188.48 --> 1192.919  and he plays Knight H4 check he plants
1190.36 --> 1195.6  the Knight look at can we just look at
1192.919 --> 1198.919  that Knight's Journey Knight C8 Knight
1195.6 --> 1200.9189999999999  D6 Knight F5 Knight H4 it went for here
1198.919 --> 1202.88  to here it had multiple stops it had a
1200.919 --> 1207.039  really terrible flight itinerary but it
1202.88 --> 1209.96  paid like $8 for the tickets King F1 F5
1207.039 --> 1212.4  Ali Reza is better Ali resa is beating
1209.96 --> 1216.32  nepo with black but the position is very
1212.4 --> 1218.4  murky very unpleasant Knight to G3 this
1216.32 --> 1221.1589999999999  is another Free Pawn by the way and he
1218.4 --> 1224.0800000000002  takes it aliv resa is now up two pawns
1221.159 --> 1227.159  meanwhile Yan is still firing away and
1224.08 --> 1230.559  when this Pawn goes away this is going
1227.159 --> 1233.2800000000002  to get really really unpleasant now
1230.559 --> 1235.039  F4 giving up the Knight but attacking
1233.28 --> 1236.1589999999999  White's Knight who is weaker the Knight
1235.039 --> 1237.76  goes into the center that might have
1236.159 --> 1239.159  been a bad decision by Ali Resa by the
1237.76 --> 1240.84  way might have been better to control
1239.159 --> 1243.5200000000002  those pieces rather than allowing the
1240.84 --> 1247.039  knight in Knight A5 now Yan plays this
1243.52 --> 1250.28  crazy move what is happening Queen goes
1247.039 --> 1251.64  here I'm I beg your pardon what why did
1250.28 --> 1252.8799999999999  he abandon the bishop it would have been
1251.64 --> 1256.48  better to go
1252.88 --> 1257.919  G4 if Bishop takes G4 Knight H2 gets the
1256.48 --> 1259.4  bishop that would have been better
1257.919 --> 1261.24  instead Ali gives up the bishop
1259.4 --> 1263.64  completely and Ali Resa as you can see
1261.24 --> 1265.76  from the time 35 minutes on the clock
1263.64 --> 1268.3600000000001  here he clearly didn't like something
1265.76 --> 1270.4  about the move Knight A5 so he went here
1268.36 --> 1272.76  and all of a sudden he spent 17 minutes
1270.4 --> 1276.3200000000002  and he's down to four gives up the
1272.76 --> 1279.08  bishop goes Queen to H6 Yan plays Bishop
1276.32 --> 1281.36  F7 setting up various very nasty
1279.08 --> 1283.3999999999999  intentions over here and also walks the
1281.36 --> 1284.799  king into the center of the board and
1283.4 --> 1287.52  that my
1284.799 --> 1289.679  friends is the last that yanon nishi's
1287.52 --> 1291.32  King ever felt unsafe in this game again
1289.679 --> 1294.3600000000001  because he was surrounded by the love of
1291.32 --> 1300.279  his pieces the defense of his pieces and
1294.36 --> 1304.0  he started eating and his King walked to
1300.279 --> 1305.84  D3 and that is how a gangster plays
1304.0 --> 1308.44  chess and yanomi is the king of the
1305.84 --> 1311.039  candidates Yan pom nishi's King is the
1308.44 --> 1313.679  king of this game
1311.039 --> 1315.96  C4 Ali Resa goes completely all in
1313.679 --> 1318.679  nearly loses on time alza made this move
1315.96 --> 1320.08  he had N9 seconds to make one move he
1318.679 --> 1322.4  had like 10 seconds to make three moves
1320.08 --> 1325.08  by the way he gets to his 40th move a
1322.4 --> 1329.039  40th move to get more time but he's just
1325.08 --> 1331.72  down a rook and a couple of moves later
1329.039 --> 1333.6  he resigned and Yan pishi goes right
1331.72 --> 1336.1200000000001  back to where he started in 2022 this
1333.6 --> 1339.0  man just won again he is also in first
1336.12 --> 1340.799  place along with gukesh and
1339.0 --> 1343.679  vidit
1340.799 --> 1345.76  Insanity Insanity every game today had a
1343.679 --> 1347.76  winner this is Alexander gach whose name
1345.76 --> 1350.279  also gets cut off on the screen oh my
1347.76 --> 1353.12  goodness D4 D5 versus Anam musuk we have
1350.279 --> 1355.679  an exchange slav which is not something
1353.12 --> 1357.279  that you're used to seeing in a game at
1355.679 --> 1359.24  like the candidates let's say let's say
1357.279 --> 1360.799  Bishop F4 this is normally very very
1359.24 --> 1362.96  boring stuff I mean the position is
1360.799 --> 1366.279  symmetrical but white plays Knight E5
1362.96 --> 1369.559  very edgy move Knight to E5 all right we
1366.279 --> 1373.08  have Knight takes Pawn takes and here a
1369.559 --> 1376.52  Gambit E4 that is a complete giveaway of
1373.08 --> 1379.08  a pawn bishop B5 and then she takes on
1376.52 --> 1381.76  D7 and plays Knight to a four a
1379.08 --> 1385.12  seemingly completely innocuous
1381.76 --> 1387.32  line but muuk clearly uncomfortable
1385.12 --> 1389.8799999999999  overthinks it play thinks for 22 minutes
1387.32 --> 1391.36  in this position but everything looks
1389.88 --> 1393.44  playable now you can't play B5 because
1391.36 --> 1394.76  it's a fork you can't play King C7
1393.44 --> 1396.0800000000002  either because after Rook C1 you're
1394.76 --> 1397.919  forced into a corner and you're going to
1396.08 --> 1402.799  lose it's really unpleasant she plays
1397.919 --> 1404.76  Rook B8 but somehow there are still many
1402.799 --> 1407.48  many many threats and unpleasant things
1404.76 --> 1409.12  in this position and muzichuk just never
1407.48 --> 1411.32  gets comfortable she tries to give
1409.12 --> 1413.4399999999998  checks white plays Bishop D2 she brings
1411.32 --> 1416.72  the bishop back the bishop gets kicked
1413.44 --> 1420.48  out but black can't
1416.72 --> 1422.44  castle look try you can't why can you
1420.48 --> 1424.4  not cuz the king moved King moved you
1422.44 --> 1425.799  can't Castle anymore so the king is sort
1424.4 --> 1426.88  of dancing in the center of the board
1425.799 --> 1429.6  and I got news for you the king never
1426.88 --> 1432.6000000000001  makes it out B5 Knight B6 she tries to
1429.6 --> 1434.48  break out but all of a sudden white just
1432.6 --> 1436.9599999999998  ex just jumps the knight
1434.48 --> 1439.24  in Rook
1436.96 --> 1441.44  C7 and that's it
1439.24 --> 1443.159  Knight takes E7 why is that winning
1441.44 --> 1444.3600000000001  because whatever takes there the bishop
1443.159 --> 1447.4  will snipe you from the other side of
1444.36 --> 1449.559  the board and Alexander gachina on the
1447.4 --> 1452.1200000000001  board as well in the women's candidates
1449.559 --> 1453.72  wins a very very very nice game from
1452.12 --> 1455.6399999999999  start to finish there was a lot of
1453.72 --> 1457.6000000000001  pressure on the black position and it
1455.64 --> 1459.679  somehow seemed like this Gambit
1457.6 --> 1460.799  literally just gave up a pawn and forced
1459.679 --> 1463.24  Black's King into the center of the
1460.799 --> 1466.039  board that's it I mean black was up a
1463.24 --> 1467.64  pawn the whole game literally if you
1466.039 --> 1469.64  count the pawns white has six and black
1467.64 --> 1470.5590000000002  has seven but because black had no way
1469.64 --> 1474.0  to
1470.559 --> 1475.559  Castle the material didn't matter and as
1474.0 --> 1476.919  we got deeper and deeper into the game
1475.559 --> 1478.44  white just had more white just won this
1476.919 --> 1482.2  game straight up down upon pawn it was a
1478.44 --> 1484.76  very impressive Victory Now tandi versus
1482.2 --> 1487.559  Vali rames Babu tanong the only winner
1484.76 --> 1489.039  of day one she beat leting and this time
1487.559 --> 1491.6789999999999  we have a
1489.039 --> 1493.44  jooba London I mean you talk about
1491.679 --> 1495.52  showing up to the candidates with an
1493.44 --> 1497.279  edgy chess opening this is a blitz
1495.52 --> 1499.6  opening at the highest level but it's an
1497.279 --> 1502.279  imbalan game we have KN C6 we have
1499.6 --> 1503.559  Bishop D3 and tanong is basically just
1502.279 --> 1505.6  going to put a knight on E5 and see
1503.559 --> 1506.96  what's up she's just going to build up
1505.6 --> 1510.36  her position in a way that she's going
1506.96 --> 1513.1200000000001  to attack the center all right Bishop D6
1510.36 --> 1515.8799999999999  good Bishop middle game two players that
1513.12 --> 1516.7199999999998  hate Bishops A3 solid right nobody's
1515.88 --> 1520.679  going to
1516.72 --> 1522.6000000000001  B4 Knight A2 wow the idea of Knight A2
1520.679 --> 1524.0800000000002  is to potentially put the Knight there
1522.6 --> 1526.32  but also to maybe put the Knight where
1524.08 --> 1529.0  the queen is and then jump into the
1526.32 --> 1531.24  position Rook C8 C3 just very solid game
1529.0 --> 1533.64  very Solid V sh puts the knight in the
1531.24 --> 1535.559  center the queen slides out of the way
1533.64 --> 1537.5590000000002  the Knight goes to B4 and the Knight
1535.559 --> 1539.52  goes to D3 it's exactly what you want
1537.559 --> 1541.52  it's this beautiful harmonious game
1539.52 --> 1543.399  black trying to do stuff over here white
1541.52 --> 1544.72  trying to put something into the center
1543.399 --> 1548.559  and she does and I told you this is what
1544.72 --> 1552.3600000000001  she's going to do F3 Knight back to
1548.559 --> 1553.8799999999999  D6 Knight F4 okay I mean is there
1552.36 --> 1555.4399999999998  something Brewing I I don't think
1553.88 --> 1557.8400000000001  there's an attack Brewing okay white is
1555.44 --> 1559.76  kind of trying but certainly nothing is
1557.84 --> 1561.72  going to happen right I don't see any
1559.76 --> 1564.559  way
1561.72 --> 1566.3990000000001  to what is t e doing I mean she just
1564.559 --> 1569.399  overconfident from the previous game
1566.399 --> 1571.6789999999999  with Knight B5 Vali is but here's a
1569.399 --> 1573.4399999999998  better question what is Vali doing her
1571.679 --> 1576.88  Knights are not going to eat rocks
1573.44 --> 1580.039  horses don't eat rocks right I don't
1576.88 --> 1585.0800000000002  think they do but
1580.039 --> 1587.279  uh Queen H4 Knight H5 and tendong E is
1585.08 --> 1589.48  just a locomotive just completely
1587.279 --> 1593.6  Unleashed she's going down the G file
1589.48 --> 1598.919  Rook is on G2 Knight is on F4 Pawn is on
1593.6 --> 1601.12  E5 Knight to F6 absolutely gangster
1598.919 --> 1603.44  final
1601.12 --> 1606.279  move disconnecting everything that's
1603.44 --> 1608.64  mate and if you take it goes from bad to
1606.279 --> 1611.159  worse the other Knight jumps in the King
1608.64 --> 1613.44  has to go to the G file and when it does
1611.159 --> 1616.48  I take and then I take like this and I
1613.44 --> 1618.52  win both Rooks an absolute Avalanche
1616.48 --> 1621.88  tantoni rendered Black's position
1618.52 --> 1624.2  completely useless like a a fantastic
1621.88 --> 1628.0  game and she has two wins out of two
1624.2 --> 1629.64  games she's 2 and0 what a game this was
1628.0 --> 1631.72  I mean this was like Smooth this was
1629.64 --> 1633.8400000000001  smooth like butter she set up in a way
1631.72 --> 1636.0  that black had absolutely nothing there
1633.84 --> 1638.1999999999998  was nothing that black could do against
1636.0 --> 1641.72  White's setup white played it slowly and
1638.2 --> 1645.2  when it came time went so quick and so
1641.72 --> 1647.96  fast it was done like a boxer just just
1645.2 --> 1650.96  boom boom it was over two for two last
1647.96 --> 1653.0  game of the day Fabiano Carana after
1650.96 --> 1655.24  drawing yesterday versus Hikaru njata
1653.0 --> 1659.519  basov after drawing yesterday versus Yan
1655.24 --> 1662.2  pishi shows up plays a Sicilian
1659.519 --> 1664.559  Defense and against Fabiano's Rosal
1662.2 --> 1667.519  liimo he plays
1664.559 --> 1670.399  E5 that's crazy I mean you talk about
1667.519 --> 1671.96  surprising a guy in a sicilian E5 is one
1670.399 --> 1676.6789999999999  of the least popular moves in that
1671.96 --> 1679.48  position you can play D6 E6 G6 so many
1676.679 --> 1681.6000000000001  things E5 has been and Fabiano what he
1679.48 --> 1683.88  does in this game I mean I mean look I
1681.6 --> 1685.24  mean look at this this is wild stuff
1683.88 --> 1686.8400000000001  some of you may be wondering by the way
1685.24 --> 1689.1200000000001  why you can't take and take it's because
1686.84 --> 1691.84  black would play Queen D4 that's that's
1689.12 --> 1694.279  why so white can't just win the pawn
1691.84 --> 1696.9189999999999  black goes here D3 and Fabby here just
1694.279 --> 1700.399  says you know what let's just play
1696.919 --> 1701.8400000000001  chess play chess H3 and when you attack
1700.399 --> 1702.84  me since you're not jumping right you're
1701.84 --> 1704.32  not going to get out of the way I'm
1702.84 --> 1706.36  gonna
1704.32 --> 1709.4399999999998  take
1706.36 --> 1711.84  takes Knight H4
1709.44 --> 1713.3200000000002  so the idea by white is to put a bunch
1711.84 --> 1715.6  of Pawns on light squares he traded a
1713.32 --> 1718.48  light Square Bishop so he gets the he
1715.6 --> 1719.799  gets the pieces out of the way Knight H4
1718.48 --> 1722.6  the idea of Knight H4 quite
1719.799 --> 1725.0  straightforward F4 in the future Queen
1722.6 --> 1726.039  F3 light squares white is going to play
1725.0 --> 1731.519  on the light
1726.039 --> 1734.24  squares abasa plays Rook E8 Queen F3 G6
1731.519 --> 1737.6  okay that's a big decision G6 you can't
1734.24 --> 1738.919  go to F5 Bishop G5 from Fabiano and
1737.6 --> 1740.6  queen E3
1738.919 --> 1742.039  so Fabby taking control of the dark
1740.6 --> 1745.1589999999999  squares and the light squares in this
1742.039 --> 1747.519  position abasov plays Knight H5 all
1745.159 --> 1749.3200000000002  right Fabby has to trade the bishop and
1747.519 --> 1750.799  he brings the Knight back to F3 and
1749.32 --> 1753.2  essentially what Fab is saying in this
1750.799 --> 1755.6  position is the guy that controls the
1753.2 --> 1758.44  pawn breaks has the advantage Black's
1755.6 --> 1762.1999999999998  got a very solid formation but black is
1758.44 --> 1763.679  never going to play F5 for example like
1762.2 --> 1765.2  Fabby went here black is never going to
1763.679 --> 1767.0800000000002  go here because it just opens up
1765.2 --> 1769.0800000000002  possibilities for white this a horrible
1767.08 --> 1770.559  trade so the guy that controls the pawn
1769.08 --> 1772.559  breaks has the advantage now abasov
1770.559 --> 1774.8799999999999  plays B5 here after spending 8 minutes
1772.559 --> 1777.0  and that weakens the C5 Pawn so now
1774.88 --> 1779.24  Fabiano this is so instructive what
1777.0 --> 1781.44  fabbi does here he brings one Knight
1779.24 --> 1782.679  back he brings two knights back and
1781.44 --> 1784.0800000000002  sometimes in life you got to take a step
1782.679 --> 1785.8400000000001  back to go two steps forwards well
1784.08 --> 1788.36  Fabiano takes two steps back so that
1785.84 --> 1789.9599999999998  means by the law of mathematics which I
1788.36 --> 1792.32  just invented means he's going to go
1789.96 --> 1794.08  four steps forwards F4 I told you about
1792.32 --> 1796.039  this move a long time ago remember a
1794.08 --> 1797.519  long time ago I said Knight H4 preparing
1796.039 --> 1799.44  various f- Pawn advancements well it
1797.519 --> 1801.3990000000001  took fabon a little while to figure out
1799.44 --> 1804.76  and bite his time but there it is all
1801.399 --> 1807.36  right now we trade and he's got a line
1804.76 --> 1809.679  of attack all right this game has been
1807.36 --> 1811.1999999999998  smooth sailing so far from Fabby he's
1809.679 --> 1812.6000000000001  now going to have to deal with the
1811.2 --> 1815.519  counterplay look at this look at this
1812.6 --> 1818.12  idea by the way B4 what an idea the
1815.519 --> 1820.6  point is to split up the pawns so that
1818.12 --> 1822.4399999999998  after the trade these guys are frozen
1820.6 --> 1824.0  you can't take because the queen would
1822.44 --> 1827.039  be walking away from the defense of the
1824.0 --> 1829.84  king E5 is vicious smacked here smacked
1827.039 --> 1834.039  here bad news that's why abasov tries to
1829.84 --> 1836.519  get rid of his weakness but Pawn takes
1834.039 --> 1838.039  and abasov here should probably take the
1836.519 --> 1840.559  pawn back
1838.039 --> 1842.279  fast he didn't like something I think he
1840.559 --> 1844.08  didn't like the queen getting into B6
1842.279 --> 1845.64  which is why he does this but Fai now
1844.08 --> 1849.0  just doesn't give up the pawn that was a
1845.64 --> 1850.64  massive decision from abasov E5 Fabi
1849.0 --> 1852.279  continuing to hammer away in the center
1850.64 --> 1853.96  of the board you may be wondering why
1852.279 --> 1856.6  there was no capture because after take
1853.96 --> 1860.3600000000001  take Queen E3 too many weaknesses Queen
1856.6 --> 1861.84  D6 Knight E4 and you lose so F5 abasov
1860.36 --> 1864.559  says I don't want to trade Fabiano says
1861.84 --> 1866.519  you're going to trade the pieces because
1864.559 --> 1867.96  I'm up a pawn I need to get to my Pawn
1866.519 --> 1871.279  but abasov is defending himself very
1867.96 --> 1873.08  well Rook A8 Knight B3 now abasov goes
1871.279 --> 1874.84  nuts he starts counterattacking with the
1873.08 --> 1878.48  Pawns in front of his King but it turns
1874.84 --> 1880.32  out to be the best moves Rook F2 giving
1878.48 --> 1883.08  up the pawn on C4 but getting the pawn
1880.32 --> 1886.1589999999999  back on F5 it's a very tense
1883.08 --> 1887.32  game but abasov makes a fatal mistake
1886.159 --> 1889.919  what he should have done is he should
1887.32 --> 1891.76  have played Queen to E6 and after Rook
1889.919 --> 1893.6390000000001  F6 he should have just stepped forward
1891.76 --> 1898.039  but he panics a little bit and he takes
1893.639 --> 1901.799  the Knight thinking he's winning a pawn
1898.039 --> 1905.639  back but after Rook F1 it's over you
1901.799 --> 1908.039  cannot stop Rook F7 check maybe abasov
1905.639 --> 1910.799  thought somehow he was in time but this
1908.039 --> 1912.72  is a check if it wasn't a check like if
1910.799 --> 1916.9189999999999  the position was
1912.72 --> 1918.2  um this yeah Rook A1 is a great move
1916.919 --> 1921.48  because you're going to trade but
1918.2 --> 1925.1200000000001  because Rook F1 comes with a check it
1921.48 --> 1927.72  all falls apart and Fabiano Carana
1925.12 --> 1931.36  wins his first game of the candidates
1927.72 --> 1933.519  Fabiano Carana Yan pishi gukesh and
1931.36 --> 1936.0  vidit are tied for first with one and a
1933.519 --> 1938.519  half points these are your final
1936.0 --> 1940.48  standings on both sides tan everybody's
1938.519 --> 1942.48  on the board on the open side we got
1940.48 --> 1944.76  four guys that won and we got four guys
1942.48 --> 1946.3990000000001  that lost all right the women's side we
1944.76 --> 1947.6  have two winners in this round and one
1946.399 --> 1949.5189999999998  of them is a double winner from round
1947.6 --> 1951.12  one she's at two points and the only
1949.519 --> 1953.1200000000001  person even close to her is Alexandra
1951.12 --> 1955.32  gkin a nearly a one-point lead there
1953.12 --> 1957.7199999999998  already round number three is tomorrow
1955.32 --> 1960.48  incredible matchups a wait I'm having a
1957.72 --> 1964.96  great time get a course for 33% off
1960.48 --> 1964.96  while you can get out of here
