0.919 --> 9.519  a lion and a goat a short
5.96 --> 13.559000000000001  story once there was a lion in the
9.519 --> 18.0  forest he was old and weak he could not
13.559 --> 21.72  hunt other animals one day a foolish God
18.0 --> 25.48  came to ask about his
21.72 --> 29.279  health I'm very ill said the cunning
25.48 --> 30.84  lion I can't get up I can't move my
29.279 --> 34.879  limbs
30.84 --> 38.559  she came near him to help him to get up
34.879 --> 40.92  the lion jumped onto her and caught her
38.559 --> 44.12  throat in his strong
40.92 --> 47.64  Jaws that day he ate
44.12 --> 52.718999999999994  well every day he played the same
47.64 --> 55.84  trick one day a clever Fox came the lion
52.719 --> 60.28  asked him to come
55.84 --> 63.719  closer but the fox said I see footprint
60.28 --> 68.0  of animals going into your Den none of
63.719 --> 71.92  them came out he ran away yelling you
68.0 --> 75.4  can't beffo me you can't eat me
71.92 --> 79.84  bye no other animal came to help the
75.4 --> 85.0  lion after that he starved to
79.84 --> 85.0  death thank you for watching
