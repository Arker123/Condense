114.299 --> 119.18  now I will no longer be thirsty
119.579 --> 124.52  he ran and ran in great excitement
125.219 --> 131.42  the moment he leaped on the wells wall
128.16 --> 131.42  to check water
132.42 --> 141.23899999999998  he lost his balance and fell in the well

143.54 --> 152.64  how would I ever get out of this place
148.459 --> 155.519  nearby a goat was passing the well when
152.64 --> 158.17999999999998  she heard the fox she went to peep over
155.519 --> 158.18  the well
158.959 --> 164.34  hey socks
161.22 --> 169.26  what are you doing inside this well

176.22 --> 182.22  cool and refreshing water not even
179.34 --> 185.0  thinking for a second the goat jumped
182.22 --> 185.0  into the well
189.44 --> 197.519  hey Fox you were right
192.959 --> 202.34  this water is actually very refreshing
197.519 --> 202.34  I could spend all my day out here
202.68 --> 209.12  after some time the goat stops and asks
206.58 --> 209.12  the fox
209.28 --> 214.2  wait a second
211.44 --> 216.319  how in the world will we manage to get
214.2 --> 220.79899999999998  out of this world

220.799 --> 226.62  on your two feet and push me up I can
224.34 --> 230.159  manage to reach to the top of the well
226.62 --> 233.22  and then pop out of the well
230.159 --> 237.92  the goat once again without thinking
233.22 --> 237.92  twice does as the fox said

257.4 --> 263.15999999999997  have thought about the consequences

277.139 --> 283.32  danger you might get into and those wild
280.5 --> 284.22  berries they might have been harmful for
283.32 --> 286.32  you
284.22 --> 289.8  yeah
286.32 --> 293.699  one should always check before taking a
289.8 --> 297.06  step further look there is a camp and I

365.34 --> 368.84  the sour grapes
369.18 --> 372.18  foreign
375.18 --> 379.22  there lived a furry Fox
379.38 --> 385.4  he was wandering around the forest in
382.68 --> 385.40000000000003  search of food
387.6 --> 393.44  I am so hungry I need to eat something
399.0 --> 402.0  foreign
408.38 --> 415.099  was passing a Vineyard but he wasn't
411.66 --> 415.09900000000005  aware it was one
418.199 --> 425.479  I am so hungry that I can't even see
421.86 --> 425.47900000000004  what that round thing is
425.72 --> 431.819  he went a little ahead but stopped as he
429.72 --> 433.52000000000004  noticed the smell of the delicious
431.819 --> 437.22  grapes
433.52 --> 439.19899999999996  wow there are so many grapes in this
437.22 --> 443.40000000000003  Vineyard
439.199 --> 443.40000000000003  my mouth watering
445.02 --> 450.74  the fox looked at the Grapevine and
448.199 --> 450.74  drooled
454.86 --> 459.02000000000004  jumped up towards the crepes
459.08 --> 464.3  but the grapes were too high for him
466.259 --> 472.91900000000004  he tried and tried but the effort was
470.28 --> 476.75899999999996  futile
472.919 --> 479.96  he tried again and this time he was
476.759 --> 479.96000000000004  about to touch them
481.139 --> 484.699  but failed again
484.879 --> 490.91900000000004  oh I am so tired these grapes are too
489.96 --> 495.29999999999995  high
490.919 --> 498.539  I can't reach them at any cost
495.3 --> 502.08  he sat there and thought for a long time
498.539 --> 505.52  that how he can get those grapes
502.08 --> 509.12  he suddenly got up and said to himself
505.52 --> 514.039  those grapes are probably sour
509.12 --> 514.039  in fact I don't like grapes
514.08 --> 521.159  why should I try so hard for them
518.279 --> 525.8  the fox couldn't reach the grapes and
521.159 --> 525.8  hence escaped by making excuses
528.2 --> 536.779  but his tummy kept growling of hunger
531.72 --> 536.779  and he had to go without eating anything
537.019 --> 540.019  foreign
542.48 --> 549.779  the fox had to go empty-handed because
546.42 --> 553.14  he just made an excuse
549.779 --> 557.22  always remember you won't achieve your
553.14 --> 562.1  goals if you give up by making excuses
557.22 --> 562.1  so let's go and try again

713.82 --> 717.38  careful next time onwards
732.8 --> 737.8389999999999  so tofu let me tell you a story
754.82 --> 763.279  in a land far away
758.12 --> 763.279  lived a hard-working and kind Trader
766.38 --> 770.54  mostly he traded in salt
775.22 --> 782.82  he also had a horse that was very lazy
779.339 --> 786.1800000000001  and always avoided work
782.82 --> 790.4590000000001  the trader used him to carry sacks of
786.18 --> 790.459  salt from one town to the other
812.54 --> 820.139  here let me load these sacks up and
816.839 --> 824.1  let's go to the town across the river to
820.139 --> 827.1  sell this salt I am so tired today why
824.1 --> 830.639  do I have to work every day I wish I
827.1 --> 832.98  could sleep throughout the day but no I
830.639 --> 835.279  have to carry these loads of salt and
832.98 --> 835.279  move
835.74 --> 838.4590000000001  foreign
841.579 --> 848.0999999999999  horse start walking cross that bridge
845.22 --> 850.399  until then I'll pack some food for
848.1 --> 850.399  myself
865.44 --> 869.4200000000001  the horse was crossing the river
869.579 --> 874.8199999999999  suddenly he slipped and fell into the
872.699 --> 874.8199999999999  water
877.32 --> 883.6800000000001  as he was carrying sacks of salt on his
880.38 --> 886.04  back the salt got wet and dissolved in
883.68 --> 886.04  the water
895.139 --> 901.0790000000001  the sacks on his back were lighter
898.079 --> 901.079  foreign
910.16 --> 917.459  wow this seems to be a good idea every
914.519 --> 920.699  time I tip in the river the salt would
917.459 --> 924.2399999999999  dissolve and my burden could be less I
920.699 --> 928.0999999999999  must try doing this more often I hope
924.24 --> 928.1  Master is not watching
932.699 --> 936.8389999999999  thank you
934.199 --> 937.8599999999999  when the master reached the town to sell
936.839 --> 941.2790000000001  the salt
937.86 --> 943.8000000000001  it weighed just half of what he loaded
941.279 --> 947.519  thinking it might be his miscalculation
943.8 --> 951.56  he sold whatever salt was left
947.519 --> 951.5600000000001  and returned home with his horse
965.54 --> 972.24  the next morning he again loaded his
968.88 --> 976.459  horse with the sacks of salt
972.24 --> 976.4590000000001  and started to pack his food
978.36 --> 983.399  the horse yet again started walking
981.18 --> 986.279  before him
983.399 --> 988.86  and made it to the bridge
986.279 --> 992.8389999999999  I must try the dipping trick again
988.86 --> 992.839  before Master reaches here
1004.639 --> 1007.639  foreign
1036.699 --> 1041.559  the trader got really confused
1042.62 --> 1048.339  as the sacks started weighing lesser
1045.62 --> 1048.339  every time
1052.84 --> 1059.86  the horse purposely started slipping
1056.059 --> 1059.86  into the water every day
1062.12 --> 1066.76  so that the sacks became lighter
1079.24 --> 1085.24  one day the trader followed the horse
1098.2 --> 1103.82  and hid in the bushes
1100.82 --> 1103.82  foreign
1109.46 --> 1115.8400000000001  to his surprise he noticed the horse's
1113.059 --> 1115.84  new trick
1123.16 --> 1131.38  oh that's so funny
1126.08 --> 1131.3799999999999  must teach this lazy horse a lesson soon
1132.559 --> 1140.559  so the following day instead of salt the
1136.22 --> 1140.559  trader filled the sacks it's cotton
1140.86 --> 1145.6  and tied him to the horse's back
1159.2 --> 1165.52  out of his new habit the horse purposely
1162.26 --> 1165.52  fell into the river
1173.539 --> 1180.559  oh no no what is happening today what is
1177.86 --> 1185.36  going wrong how are these sacks getting
1180.559 --> 1188.1789999999999  heavier oh my back hurts what
1185.36 --> 1190.8799999999999  this time as the sacks were filled with
1188.179 --> 1193.3600000000001  cotton it soaked water and became
1190.88 --> 1193.3600000000001  heavier
1194.0 --> 1199.52  the horse dipped again and again in
1196.76 --> 1204.28  water thinking to drain the salt off
1199.52 --> 1204.28  somehow but all went in there
1206.659 --> 1213.0390000000002  he somehow managed to get up
1210.08 --> 1213.039  cross the bridge
1215.799 --> 1224.799  he sat on the ground and panted as the
1219.679 --> 1224.799  sacks had gotten really really heavy
1235.539 --> 1243.7  the trader laughed at him and said
1239.2 --> 1248.48  horse I am your master this is your work
1243.7 --> 1251.6000000000001  I work very hard and worship my work I
1248.48 --> 1255.44  don't make excuses of fine tricks to
1251.6 --> 1258.32  fool others and avoid work
1255.44 --> 1261.02  I must teach you to never repeat this
1258.32 --> 1263.6589999999999  and avoid your work
1261.02 --> 1267.82  the horse learned his lesson and never
1263.659 --> 1267.8200000000002  tried to avoid his work again
1271.299 --> 1279.26  what a wise Trader
1275.299 --> 1281.72  bright tofu he taught the lazy horse a
1279.26 --> 1284.96  good lesson

1378.14 --> 1384.679  known to be clever and cunning my
1381.919 --> 1388.76  childhood memories with wolves are quite
1384.679 --> 1392.3600000000001  interesting especially the story of the
1388.76 --> 1396.5  wolf and the seven little goats the wolf
1392.36 --> 1401.74  and the seven little gods wow I haven't
1396.5 --> 1401.74  heard that one tell me the story Tia
1402.74 --> 1407.6200000000001  the wolf and the seven little goats
1407.799 --> 1415.6589999999999  once upon a time there lived a mama goat
1411.679 --> 1420.2  and her seven little kids
1415.659 --> 1423.0800000000002  this was a happy little home all the
1420.2 --> 1424.4  seven little kids used to play in The
1423.08 --> 1428.059  Meadows
1424.4 --> 1430.1000000000001  into the wild with the butterflies and
1428.059 --> 1433.46  birds singing along
1430.1 --> 1436.779  the days used to go in complete Harmony
1433.46 --> 1436.779  and Bliss
1437.9 --> 1446.5  until one day a big black wolf noticed
1443.36 --> 1448.1  these little kids playing in the middle
1446.5 --> 1452.24  hahaha
1448.1 --> 1456.5  such an easy treat there for me I
1452.24 --> 1460.039  haven't eaten since ages I'm sure these
1456.5 --> 1463.22  would make delicious lamb chops for my
1460.039 --> 1465.74  dinner tonight he waited for the moment
1463.22 --> 1467.14  when the mother goat would leave her
1465.74 --> 1471.7  kids alone
1467.14 --> 1471.7  patiently hiding in the bushes

1891.799 --> 1897.5  belly was so heavy that he could hardly
1895.82 --> 1900.5  walk

1900.5 --> 1906.98  reach the well
1902.96 --> 1909.44  moment he bent down to drink water he
1906.98 --> 1912.919  couldn't handle the weight and fell in
1909.44 --> 1915.679  the well the kids were looking at all of
1912.919 --> 1916.94  this from their window and shouted

2000.299 --> 2007.44  I'll tell you an interesting story
2003.58 --> 2007.4399999999998  Fox and the sick lion
2011.22 --> 2017.519  once upon a time there lived a lion in
2014.919 --> 2017.519  the forest
2020.919 --> 2027.22  as the lion was growing old he was
2024.34 --> 2029.4399999999998  unable to hunt for his food
2027.22 --> 2031.919  foreign
2029.44 --> 2036.179  he
2031.919 --> 2036.179  would die of starvation
2044.88 --> 2049.799  so the lion thought of a plan
2056.579 --> 2063.2200000000003  he decided to lie down in the cave and
2060.879 --> 2066.22  pretend that he is ill
2063.22 --> 2066.22  foreign
2077.399 --> 2083.2599999999998  whosoever will come to meet him will
2080.379 --> 2085.96  become his prey
2083.26 --> 2089.0200000000004  being the king of the jungle the lion
2085.96 --> 2093.159  announced he was sick and summoned the
2089.02 --> 2095.399  animals to come and hear his last will
2093.159 --> 2095.399  foreign
2113.339 --> 2118.56  put his sinful plan to practice and it
2116.74 --> 2121.66  started working
2118.56 --> 2125.859  four animals didn't know about his
2121.66 --> 2129.8999999999996  Wicked plan and fell into his trap many
2125.859 --> 2129.9  of his well-wishers got killed
2160.68 --> 2166.7999999999997  one day a fox came to visit the sick
2164.44 --> 2166.8  lion
2169.78 --> 2174.7200000000003  the fox was clever and discovered the
2172.839 --> 2178.599  trick
2174.72 --> 2182.3199999999997  he stood on the outside of the cave at a
2178.599 --> 2186.1600000000003  respectful distance and asked
2182.32 --> 2187.06  how are you sir I am not feeling well at
2186.16 --> 2192.04  all
2187.06 --> 2194.7599999999998  but why don't you come inside to meet me
2192.04 --> 2194.7599999999998  thank you sir
2198.4 --> 2208.2000000000003  there are no trace of any returning
2202.54 --> 2208.2  still if I come inside I would be a fool
2208.72 --> 2215.5789999999997  and the fox saved his life and informed
2212.26 --> 2215.579  other animals too
2220.079 --> 2227.82  so tofu the moral of the story is you
2224.079 --> 2227.82  should never trust a fake person
2242.619 --> 2245.619  foreign
2250.68 --> 2255.72  what in the world are you trying to do
2256.42 --> 2263.02  I am trying to plant those juicy fruits
2260.02 --> 2265.839  from this tree
2263.02 --> 2269.619  but do you think you would be able to
2265.839 --> 2271.06  pluck them they are so high
2269.619 --> 2274.54  oh
2271.06 --> 2278.98  I wish I could fly and pluck those
2274.54 --> 2282.16  fruits I so wish I had wings
2278.98 --> 2284.94  two wishes not bad but one should be
2282.16 --> 2288.96  conscious about the consequences come
2284.94 --> 2288.96  I'll tell you a story
2292.18 --> 2296.2799999999997  The Tortoise and the eagle
2302.94 --> 2307.7200000000003  a young tortoise was lazing around a
2306.339 --> 2312.54  riverbank
2307.72 --> 2312.54  looking at the birds flying in the sky
2314.56 --> 2318.16  stared at them and started thinking out
2317.14 --> 2322.54  aloud
2318.16 --> 2325.2999999999997  I wish I could fly like those birds up
2322.54 --> 2328.48  high in the sky and watch the beautiful
2325.3 --> 2330.2200000000003  sceneries and beauty of the world from
2328.48 --> 2335.2  Top of the World
2330.22 --> 2338.3199999999997  oh I so wish that nearby an eagle was
2335.2 --> 2340.839  sitting on a stone listening to what the
2338.32 --> 2344.1400000000003  tortoise was thinking out loud and
2340.839 --> 2345.82  couldn't resist but ask why do you want
2344.14 --> 2348.22  to fly
2345.82 --> 2351.76  you should be happy with what you are
2348.22 --> 2354.8199999999997  gifted with I wish I could fly with no
2351.76 --> 2357.2200000000003  trouble of crawling on the ground so say
2354.82 --> 2359.92  that you want to fly because you don't
2357.22 --> 2363.7  want to crawl not because you wish to
2359.92 --> 2365.92  see the world from the sky anyway what
2363.7 --> 2368.2599999999998  will I get in return for making you fly
2365.92 --> 2371.079  in the sky
2368.26 --> 2374.099  I'll give you the riches of gold from
2371.079 --> 2374.099  the Red Sea
2377.64 --> 2385.5989999999997  so the eagle grabbed the tortoise in its
2381.099 --> 2388.0  claws and soared up high in the sky
2385.599 --> 2391.44  making him see all the beautiful
2388.0 --> 2391.44  sceneries of the world
2392.02 --> 2396.52  flying higher in the clouds and closer
2394.96 --> 2399.4  to the Stars
2396.52 --> 2402.0  it was indeed a mesmerizing moment for
2399.4 --> 2402.0  the tortoise
2402.78 --> 2407.98  while the eagle was flying over the
2405.7 --> 2411.16  riverbank
2407.98 --> 2412.56  the rest of the tortoise were basking in
2411.16 --> 2415.72  the sun
2412.56 --> 2417.16  suddenly the tortoise flying high up in
2415.72 --> 2420.52  the sky said
2417.16 --> 2423.94  I wish my friends could watch me flying
2420.52 --> 2426.579  so high in the sky I am sure they would
2423.94 --> 2430.0  get jealous watching me
2426.579 --> 2433.119  what why would you want your friends to
2430.0 --> 2437.38  get jealous of you I want them to see
2433.119 --> 2439.0  that I can fly and they cannot it's such
2437.38 --> 2442.0  a nice feeling
2439.0 --> 2443.8  what an evil friend this tortoise is
2442.0 --> 2446.74  thought the eagle
2443.8 --> 2448.119  with this the eagle drops him on the
2446.74 --> 2451.8999999999996  ground
2448.119 --> 2454.48  and asked for his treasure Now give me
2451.9 --> 2458.26  my reward
2454.48 --> 2460.72  there is no reward I was just kidding
2458.26 --> 2463.5  about the gold so that you could take me
2460.72 --> 2463.5  for a ride
2463.54 --> 2470.14  and with this the tortoise left the
2467.38 --> 2474.06  eagle couldn't tolerate his insult and
2470.14 --> 2474.06  decided to teach him a lesson
2474.72 --> 2481.5989999999997  so the next day the eagle went to the
2478.119 --> 2486.94  tortoise and said hey would you like to
2481.599 --> 2489.54  go for a sky ride again yes sure I would
2486.94 --> 2489.54  love to
2491.98 --> 2499.02  the eagle once again picked him up and
2495.339 --> 2499.02  clenched him in his claws
2499.119 --> 2504.94  the tortoise while enjoying the ride
2501.76 --> 2507.46  said to the eagle why did you bring me
2504.94 --> 2510.88  again for the ride even though I
2507.46 --> 2514.119  Dishonored my promise of rewarding you
2510.88 --> 2518.02  that's because tortoise you wish to make
2514.119 --> 2521.44  your friends jealous but at my cost and
2518.02 --> 2525.52  now I'll let you enjoy the Free Fall
2521.44 --> 2527.7400000000002  the eagle lets his claws loose and the
2525.52 --> 2531.88  Tortoise went falling down
2527.74 --> 2535.54  screaming for help and flying no longer
2531.88 --> 2539.6800000000003  he crashed on the ground with a thud
2535.54 --> 2543.04  thanks to his show he didn't get injured
2539.68 --> 2544.1189999999997  soon his old friend surrounded him and
2543.04 --> 2548.14  said
2544.119 --> 2551.6800000000003  hey our young friend you wanted to see
2548.14 --> 2556.06  the world from high up in the sky to
2551.68 --> 2559.18  dream big is not a sin but to dream it
2556.06 --> 2561.339  at the cost of others is just not
2559.18 --> 2564.64  justifiable

2570.22 --> 2576.04  life I should be happy with what I have

2576.04 --> 2581.68  selfish reasons I surely have learned my

2585.46 --> 2590.28  say
2587.56 --> 2593.2  I learned a lesson too
2590.28 --> 2597.52  one should think about the consequences
2593.2 --> 2600.46  before one wishes for something
2597.52 --> 2603.04  I should be happy with what I am blessed
2600.46 --> 2606.64  with I should rather look for an
2603.04 --> 2610.8  alternative to pluck those fruits
2606.64 --> 2616.0789999999997  wait I'll get a ladder
2610.8 --> 2616.079  tofu you learn things quite fast
2631.26 --> 2637.119  dear where are you I am here tofu what
2636.22 --> 2640.8999999999996  happened
2637.119 --> 2643.6600000000003  Tia you keep on teaching me new morals
2640.9 --> 2645.819  through different stories today I'll
2643.66 --> 2650.14  tell you a story that a teacher taught
2645.819 --> 2652.859  us in class oh really I'm so eager to
2650.14 --> 2652.859  listen to it
2653.38 --> 2660.76  the dog and the bone
2656.74 --> 2663.2999999999997  Once Upon a Time in the dark alleys of a
2660.76 --> 2663.3  small village
2666.42 --> 2672.76  she was a stray dog who had to live on
2669.819 --> 2675.579  anything that he found on the streets
2672.76 --> 2678.28  in the bins or at the mercy of the
2675.579 --> 2679.44  people who would feed him every now and
2678.28 --> 2683.26  then
2679.44 --> 2686.5  one day while passing by a butcher's
2683.26 --> 2688.9  shop he saw that there was no one to
2686.5 --> 2692.26  attend the shop
2688.9 --> 2696.64  he entered the shop and his eyes popped
2692.26 --> 2700.42  out when he saw juicy chicken land pork
2696.64 --> 2703.66  and turkey hanging it was far from his
2700.42 --> 2706.5  reach so he went around the cabinets to
2703.66 --> 2706.5  look for something
2706.54 --> 2713.44  I hope I could find something to eat
2709.72 --> 2717.4599999999996  here he went around sniffing and looking
2713.44 --> 2721.9  for it and suddenly he saw a juicy Big
2717.46 --> 2723.579  Bone he started drooling and said my day
2721.9 --> 2728.579  is made
2723.579 --> 2728.579  this would surely fill up my tummy
2729.3 --> 2737.1400000000003  in his mouth I'll eat this juicy bone in
2733.9 --> 2740.56  a quiet place when no one else would be
2737.14 --> 2743.68  able to take it away from me so the lean
2740.56 --> 2747.16  dog very happily took the bone and
2743.68 --> 2749.3999999999996  looked for a secluded place
2747.16 --> 2749.3999999999996  foreign
2759.339 --> 2764.14  while he was trying to cross a river he
2762.88 --> 2766.48  stopped
2764.14 --> 2769.9  and looked at his reflection in the
2766.48 --> 2773.5  river he was quite surprised at what he
2769.9 --> 2774.339  saw he saw his own reflection and
2773.5 --> 2779.4  thought
2774.339 --> 2779.4  oh my God he was another dog
2779.819 --> 2787.06  it looks young too I got to have that
2783.94 --> 2789.7000000000003  bone as well and the moment the greedy
2787.06 --> 2793.599  dog decided to bark at the other door
2789.7 --> 2796.8999999999996  the bone fell in the river
2793.599 --> 2800.02  oh what have I done
2796.9 --> 2804.46  it was my reflection in the water
2800.02 --> 2808.119  Reed made me lose my bone too he went
2804.46 --> 2809.76  away in sorrow with surely a lesson to
2808.119 --> 2813.6400000000003  be learned
2809.76 --> 2817.0600000000004  wow tofu that surely was a beautiful
2813.64 --> 2820.5989999999997  story so what do you think is the moral
2817.06 --> 2825.2799999999997  of the story Being Greedy is not good
2820.599 --> 2827.7000000000003  because a bird in hand is worth three in
2825.28 --> 2827.7000000000003  the bush
2828.4 --> 2831.4  foreign
2864.24 --> 2869.339  hey Tia that monkey over there tried to
2867.76 --> 2873.7000000000003  imitate me
2869.339 --> 2878.46  oh really Tia why are you laughing
2873.7 --> 2878.46  wait I'll tell you why monkeys do this
2879.76 --> 2883.92  the monkeys and the cap seller
2900.119 --> 2906.54  once a cap seller was going to sell his
2903.819 --> 2911.5  caps in a Village Market
2906.54 --> 2914.8  stops gaps five rupees caps 10 Rupees
2911.5 --> 2917.5  caps caps caps
2914.8 --> 2920.98  he was going through a forest
2917.5 --> 2923.4  he was carrying a basket of red caps on
2920.98 --> 2923.4  his head
2925.559 --> 2933.94  he got tired In the Heat of the Sun
2930.599 --> 2937.3590000000004  and thought of lying down under a tree
2933.94 --> 2939.48  for some time he put his basket on the
2937.359 --> 2939.48  ground
2941.5 --> 2947.099  I am so tired let me take a small nap
2951.28 --> 2955.2000000000003  that the monkeys on that tree
2970.079 --> 2973.619  they came down
2981.9 --> 2989.46  and one by one took all the Caps from
2986.02 --> 2989.46  the cap seller's basket
2998.4 --> 3002.96  then they climbed on the tree
3003.98 --> 3010.02  when the cap seller woke up he was
3007.14 --> 3013.5  shocked to see his basket empty he
3010.02 --> 3016.74  searched for his caps everywhere
3013.5 --> 3019.4  to his surprise he saw the monkeys were
3016.74 --> 3019.3999999999996  wearing them
3021.24 --> 3026.0  found that the monkeys for imitating him
3029.46 --> 3036.619  so he started throwing his cap down and
3033.18 --> 3036.6189999999997  the monkeys did so
3036.839 --> 3043.5  the cap seller collected all the Caps
3040.02 --> 3047.119  put them back in his basket
3043.5 --> 3047.119  and went away happily
3053.24 --> 3060.54  so tofu we should deal with cleverness
3057.0 --> 3062.52  in such situations because wisdom helps
3060.54 --> 3065.42  during difficult times
3062.52 --> 3065.42  I understand

3108.72 --> 3111.9199999999996  Dove and the Ant
3118.76 --> 3125.5400000000004  one hot day an ant was walking near a
3122.94 --> 3125.54  river bank
3129.98 --> 3137.3  the poor ant lost its balance and fell
3134.28 --> 3137.3  inside the water
3139.16 --> 3145.319  please help me
3142.02 --> 3148.2  she screamed for help as the flow of the
3145.319 --> 3150.92  river was too strong she was carried

3158.28 --> 3162.6600000000003  Adele was watching all this from a
3161.099 --> 3165.42  nearby tree
3162.66 --> 3166.319  the ant was struggling for life in the
3165.42 --> 3168.9  water
3166.319 --> 3171.5  the dove felt very sad for the little
3168.9 --> 3171.5  Anne
3175.14 --> 3178.7  decided to help her

3194.7 --> 3199.14  and dropped it into the water near the
3197.4 --> 3202.02  struggling ant
3199.14 --> 3205.14  the ant moved towards the leaf and
3202.02 --> 3209.64  climbed up there and the Ant reached to
3205.14 --> 3212.7599999999998  the shore safely the thankful aunt said
3209.64 --> 3214.94  always be grateful to you for saving my
3212.76 --> 3214.94  life
3218.099 --> 3225.3590000000004  few weeks later the aunt saw a bad
3221.94 --> 3228.42  Hunter with a gun
3225.359 --> 3231.44  the hunter was targeting at the dove
3228.42 --> 3231.44  sitting on the tree
3236.22 --> 3242.3999999999996  guessing what he was about to do the ant
3239.339 --> 3246.96  quickly bit him on the heel
3242.4 --> 3249.96  ouch you pathetic ant what have you done
3246.96 --> 3249.96  foreign

3258.119 --> 3261.619  help the dove in return
3276.799 --> 3284.4  so tofu just the way that's good deed
3281.099 --> 3288.2400000000002  helped him to get out of danger by the
3284.4 --> 3293.2200000000003  ant similarly Every Good Deed we do for

3307.079 --> 3312.0  Peppa
3308.7 --> 3315.18  it is important to be clever but one
3312.0 --> 3319.2  should use it only for good reason
3315.18 --> 3322.0989999999997  not to hurt someone come I'll tell you a
3319.2 --> 3325.14  story of a clever monkey and a crocodile
3322.099 --> 3329.2400000000002  who thought he was clever but was
3325.14 --> 3329.24  actually a big fool
3329.48 --> 3333.38  the clever monkey
3334.74 --> 3341.8999999999996  Once Upon a Time on a Riverside
3338.4 --> 3345.9  lived a monkey on a tree
3341.9 --> 3349.92  the place was a paradise for him because
3345.9 --> 3352.6800000000003  just hopping on a stone he used to reach
3349.92 --> 3354.0  a small island in the middle of the
3352.68 --> 3358.0789999999997  river
3354.0 --> 3361.04  which was a dawned by choicist and
3358.079 --> 3364.619  juiciest of fruits
3361.04 --> 3368.24  in the vicinity of the island there
3364.619 --> 3368.2400000000002  lived a crocodile couple
3370.26 --> 3378.8590000000004  and every day they used to drool at the
3373.5 --> 3378.859  monkey hopping in and out of the island
3381.24 --> 3387.1189999999997  but the monkey was so clever that the
3384.18 --> 3390.3799999999997  crocodile couple never managed to lay
3387.119 --> 3390.38  their hands on the monkey
3391.88 --> 3399.9  one day the female crocodile said dare
3396.839 --> 3401.119  has spent I have a plan to nap this
3399.9 --> 3404.46  monkey
3401.119 --> 3406.319  ah none of our tricks have burped with
3404.46 --> 3409.799  this clever monkey
3406.319 --> 3412.98  what brilliant idea do you have now
3409.799 --> 3416.099  the female crocodile whispered in his
3412.98 --> 3419.059  ears and all he could do was laugh
3416.099 --> 3419.059  sheepishly
3420.059 --> 3426.42  the next day when the monkey was busy
3423.119 --> 3430.559  feasting on fruits on the island
3426.42 --> 3433.339  the crocodile very silently went and sat
3430.559 --> 3433.3390000000004  on the stone
3437.46 --> 3444.299  when the monkey was done with eating he
3441.0 --> 3447.24  was about to hop onto the stone when
3444.299 --> 3450.92  suddenly he realized that the stone is
3447.24 --> 3450.9199999999996  looking bigger than usual
3452.46 --> 3458.579  he understood that it was a crocodile
3455.16 --> 3463.02  waiting for him he called out to the
3458.579 --> 3467.4  crocodile is that you Mr Crocodile no no
3463.02 --> 3469.74  it's not me and the monkey thought how
3467.4 --> 3472.7400000000002  dumb could the crocodile get
3469.74 --> 3474.4799999999996  so he thought for a second and called
3472.74 --> 3477.4799999999996  out to the crocodile
3474.48 --> 3481.88  oh you surely Charlotte me this time
3477.48 --> 3481.88  I'll make your job easier now
3482.099 --> 3490.76  and I'll jump into it on my own the
3485.88 --> 3490.76  foolish crocodile opened his wide mouth
3491.28 --> 3498.0  with his eyes shut and waited for the
3494.7 --> 3501.299  monkey to jump the clever monkey who was
3498.0 --> 3503.94  watching the closed eye crocodile hopped
3501.299 --> 3506.359  on the head of the crocodile and crossed
3503.94 --> 3506.359  the river
3506.599 --> 3513.48  you couldn't fool me this time either by
3510.66 --> 3518.48  clear and clever thinking the monkey
3513.48 --> 3518.48  managed to trick the foolish crocodile
3520.22 --> 3527.52  the crocodile was indeed a fool who got
3524.52 --> 3530.94  tricked by the clever monkey yeah tofu
3527.52 --> 3534.72  and the moral is that we must think
3530.94 --> 3537.599  before we do anything like that clever
3534.72 --> 3539.9399999999996  monkey and not like that foolish
3537.599 --> 3542.94  crocodile

3605.28 --> 3607.76  throat

3649.819 --> 3654.74  crane took pity on the wolf
3658.799 --> 3663.38  even though the task was dangerous
3665.099 --> 3670.38  The Lure of the Prophet motivated him to
3669.18 --> 3674.24  help

4042.74 --> 4046.819  others
4043.819 --> 4050.359  come I'll tell you a story about a fox
4046.819 --> 4055.2799999999997  who became a laughing stock amongst his
4050.359 --> 4057.819  friends just because he was very selfish
4055.28 --> 4057.8190000000004  foreign
4062.74 --> 4068.5589999999997  one day a fox was walking in a forest
4070.839 --> 4077.839  suddenly he heard a huge snap and in an
4074.96 --> 4081.02  immigrant reaction he jumped
4077.839 --> 4082.94  but something also happened to the poor
4081.02 --> 4087.079  little thing
4082.94 --> 4090.5  he found his tail stuck in a trap and
4087.079 --> 4096.799  this gave a sharp pain in his rear
4090.5 --> 4099.819  oh ah that hurts so much oh my tail is
4096.799 --> 4103.04  stuck in a trap what would I do now
4099.819 --> 4106.759  after battling for long with his tail
4103.04 --> 4110.12  and the trap he gave a final try to it
4106.759 --> 4112.42  and with that came another snapping
4110.12 --> 4112.42  voice
4114.859 --> 4120.9400000000005  tears coming out of his eyes the fox
4117.98 --> 4120.94  moaned
4121.46 --> 4129.259  my tail my tail
4125.239 --> 4132.799  I lost my furry beautiful tail
4129.259 --> 4135.799  what would I do now I've become laughing
4132.799 --> 4139.6  stock of my skulk now
4135.799 --> 4139.6  this is so embarrassing
4140.239 --> 4148.299  and he walked deeper into the forest
4143.179 --> 4148.299  with his head bowed down in sorrow
4150.259 --> 4157.64  when suddenly an idea struck his mind
4154.279 --> 4159.88  he decided to call a meeting of all his
4157.64 --> 4159.88  friends
4166.48 --> 4171.0199999999995  friends I have gathered you for a reason
4169.759 --> 4174.38  today
4171.02 --> 4179.96  while walking through the forest I kept
4174.38 --> 4182.0  wondering we have eyes nose ears teeth
4179.96 --> 4184.52  legs
4182.0 --> 4187.0  all for some reason
4184.52 --> 4190.9400000000005  foreign
4187.0 --> 4194.42  but why why do we need a tail
4190.94 --> 4197.48  it's a useless thing and keeps bothering
4194.42 --> 4200.36  us for some reason or the other it
4197.48 --> 4203.78  either gets in way of our sitting or
4200.36 --> 4205.639999999999  when kept outside is left for someone to
4203.78 --> 4209.179  trip over
4205.64 --> 4213.08  so after a deep thought I cut off my
4209.179 --> 4216.4400000000005  tail and wants you to do the same
4213.08 --> 4217.46  it feels great without that useless
4216.44 --> 4220.759999999999  thing
4217.46 --> 4224.14  the skalk fox kept looking at the fox in
4220.76 --> 4228.14  amazement as to what he was saying
4224.14 --> 4231.400000000001  it's true but nobody has really thought
4228.14 --> 4235.12  about them without the tail
4231.4 --> 4239.54  it surely would be painful to do that
4235.12 --> 4244.599999999999  meanwhile a young agile fox jumped onto
4239.54 --> 4244.6  the higher place and addressed the skulk
4244.88 --> 4251.9800000000005  are you saying this because you no
4247.699 --> 4251.98  longer have a beautiful fairy tale

4255.739 --> 4261.799999999999  self-interest so that you don't get
4258.739 --> 4264.099999999999  embarrassed and feel left out of the
4261.8 --> 4264.1  skull
4264.8 --> 4270.9800000000005  and the rest of the skull went off
4267.38 --> 4274.34  laughing away and discussing as to how
4270.98 --> 4277.639999999999  selfish and mean the fox is
4274.34 --> 4282.159000000001  in order to not feel embarrassed he
4277.64 --> 4282.159000000001  wants everyone to chop off their tail
4283.88 --> 4292.84  yeah now I understood I shouldn't be
