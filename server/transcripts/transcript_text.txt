0.165 --> 2.685   
2.685 --> 5.9350000000000005   
6.155 --> 7.155   
13.025 --> 15.965  The name of the story is
15.995 --> 17.775  Clever Fish
18.445 --> 21.345  One day, a fisher man
21.345 --> 23.945  would fishing to a river
24.035 --> 25.135  as usual
26.395 --> 29.005  He throw his net into the river
29.315 --> 32.485  And he just sat waiting there for
32.485 --> 33.644999999999996  fish together
34.095 --> 35.185  So that
35.505 --> 38.905  He could sell a lot of fish in the market
39.735 --> 41.565  and get some good money from the fish
43.075 --> 44.245000000000005  after sometimes
44.785 --> 45.785  fisher man
46.185 --> 49.255  hooked relevant basil in the net
49.955 --> 53.085  Thinking that, he must got a lot of fish
53.085 --> 55.515  in the net
56.235 --> 59.475  He acted to count the net out of
59.475 --> 60.475  water
62.175 --> 63.175  But then
63.245 --> 65.725   
65.725 --> 68.54499999999999  he saw
68.545 --> 69.825  there is one tiny little fish in that net
71.045 --> 73.105   
74.065 --> 75.255  but then suddenly
75.765 --> 78.485  the fish start to taking to him
78.815 --> 81.375  said to the fisher man
82.035 --> 84.595  oh fisher man, please please
84.735 --> 87.295  please, leave me
87.295 --> 90.185  please leave me
90.185 --> 92.315   
93.665 --> 96.56500000000001  but fisher man did not give any attention
96.565 --> 99.765  to the request of the fish
100.395 --> 101.395  But then
102.135 --> 104.78500000000001  again, the tiny little fish
104.785 --> 106.115  said to the fisher man
106.685 --> 109.885  oh fisher man, I will tell you something
109.885 --> 113.305  which is a huge help
113.335 --> 116.35499999999999  If you leave me back in water
116.365 --> 119.345  I will tell all my friends about you. And I bring them
119.345 --> 122.095  to the bank coffee first. So that,
122.095 --> 124.065  when you come next time
124.765 --> 126.815  you have much more fish
129.045 --> 130.99499999999998  Fisher man talk to himself
131.345 --> 134.725  WOW, That is not bad
135.435 --> 138.085  He was thinking. He found...
138.085 --> 141.275  One tiny little fish today
141.275 --> 144.415  Tomorrow I will got a lot of fish
144.415 --> 147.48499999999999

167.845 --> 170.125  never to come back
171.285 --> 172.805  Poor fisher man
